A curfew has been enforced in several parts of Nagpur under Section 163 of the Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) due to rising tensions. The curfew applies to the jurisdiction of police stations in Kotwali, Ganeshpeth, Tehsil, Lakadganj, Pachpaoli, Shantinagar, Sakkardara, Nandanvan, Imamwada, Yashodharanagar, and Kapilnagar.Clashes erupted in the Chitnis Park area of Mahal around 7:30 pm, with stones hurled at police, leaving six civilians and three officers injured, according to PTI.The unrest later spread to Kotwali and Ganeshpeth, intensifying in the evening.

A fresh clash erupted near Old Bhandara Road between 10.30 pm and 11.30 pm, during which a mob set several vehicles on fire and damaged houses and a clinic.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari have urged people to maintain peace and harmony following the violence. According to police, quoted by news agency PTI, the unrest began in the late afternoon after Bajrang Dal members staged a demonstration near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue in Mahal.Rumours spread that the Quran was burned during the protest, triggering outrage within the Muslim community as videos of the demonstration circulated on social media. A complaint alleging the burning of the holy book was filed at Ganeshpeth police station in the evening.Latest developments• Following the violence, Nagpur Police have enforced prohibitory orders and detained over 20 people. Nagpur police commissioner Ravinder Singal said that Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita has been imposed, allowing magistrates to issue immediate preventive orders in urgent situations to prevent obstruction, threats to human life, public unrest, or riots.

  "articleBody": "As members of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal, along with other fringe groups, intensified their demand to remove Mughal emperor Aurangzeb’s tomb from Khuldabad, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, on the occasion of Shiv Jayanti across the state, at least 25 police and fire brigade personnel, including an IPS officer, were injured in large-scale arson, vandalism and stone-pelting incidents between two communities in the old city of Mahal, Nagpur, on Monday evening.Incidentally, the violence occurred close to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters, causing widespread panic among residents.Also Read | Aurangzeb row: Violence erupts in Nagpur; CM Fadnavis says 'don't believe any rumours'Eyewitnesses reported that tensions escalated rapidly as miscreants set several vehicles ablaze and damaged property. Videos of the incidents did the rounds on social media swiftly. Police eventually resorted to lathi-charge and fired tear gas shells to disperse violent mobs in the Chitnis Park, Mahal, and other areas of central Nagpur.The unrest followed a demonstration by members of VHP near the statue of Shivaji Maharaj, in Mahal, at 8:30 pm, as they demanded the removal of the Mughal emperor’s grave, and also burned his effigy. Hours later, it was rumoured members of Muslim groups claimed activists of Hindu outfits, including VHP and Bajrang Dal, had burned a cloth with the holy “kalma” (Islamic prayer) on it and a holy book during protests. Following this, a large number of people from the Muslim community gathered in various parts of the city, including Mahal, Kotwali, Ganeshpeth and Chitnis Park.Nagpur police commissioner Ravinder Singal stated that Section 144 has been imposed in the area to prevent further unrest. Till late evening 30 people were arrested for rioting. “A cloth was burned, which led to people gathering and raising slogans. We took immediate action, and an FIR has been registered based on the names provided to us by members of the Muslim community. The incident occurred soon after the evening prayers. While some vehicles were torched and stones pelted, the situation is now under control. The police are conducting combing operations to identify and arrest those involved. We urge citizens not to step out or take the law into their hands,” said Singal, adding except for this area other parts of the city were peaceful.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who hails from Nagpur, urged citizens to maintain peace and cooperate with the police and administration. “Do not believe in rumours. Let us work together to restore peace,” he said.Earlier in the day, while inaugurating a temple of Maratha king Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Bhiwandi, Mumbai, Fadnavis had said, “We will protect Aurangzeb’s grave but not allow his or the site’s glorification.” He made the remark responding to calls for the grave’s removal.“It is unfortunate that we have to protect Aurangzeb’s grave since it was declared a protected site by the ASI 50 years ago. Aurangzeb killed thousands of our people but we have to protect his grave,” he added.Union minister Nitin Gadkari stated, people of Nagpur who “are peace-loving should not be swayed by misinformation or rumours”. “Please do not come out onto the streets and cooperate with the law-and-order system,” Gadkari said.Pyare Khan, chairman of the State Minority Commission, and the guardian minister of Nagpur, Chandrashekhar Bawankule, made similar appeals of maintaining calm.The opposition Congress criticized the state government over the acts of violence in Nagpur. In a post on X, the state Congress Legislature Party leader Vijay Wadettiwar alleged that deliberate efforts were being made to incite conflict between communities, and blamed the ruling party for the unrest.He said, “Nagpur is a peaceful city, but it has been targeted by pro-ruling organizations. This unrest is a result of irresponsible statements made by certain cabinet ministers. The CM should remove the concerned minister from the cabinet.”Meanwhile, BJP MLA from Central Nagpur, Pravin Datke, claimed that the violence was orchestrated by individuals from outside the city. “Some people from a particular community came from outside and carried out this violence in a planned manner. Security forces have been deployed, and the chief minister is closely monitoring the situation,” he said.In Pune, members of right-wing outfits raised slogans outside the district collector’s office and submitted a memorandum – highlighting Aurangzeb’s controversial history -- addressed to Fadnavis that the Mughal emperor’s tomb be removed at the earliest, as it was a symbol of “pain and slavery”.Saamana slams BJPShiv Sena (UBT) mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ criticised BJP leaders over their announcements to destroy Aurangzeb’s grave and called them “enemies of the brave tradition of Marathas”.“Some neo-Hindutvawadia are loudly saying they will destroy Aurangzeb’s grave like Babri masjid was demolished. They just want to spread hatred in Maharashtra. Marathas fought for 25 years against Aurangzeb and finally Aurangzeb who attacked their self-esteem was buried in this soil. They want to erase this entire history,” stated the periodical’s editorial. Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray called the agitation “a mere gimmick to distract people from real issues”.(With inputs from Mumbai and Pune bureaus)",

  "articleBody": "Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Monday said that the Indian Railways has overcome the financial troubles due to the Covid pandemic with passengers returning to train travel. “Railways has successfully overcome Covid related challenges, with passengers returning to train travel and tremendous growth being registered in both passenger and cargo traffic,” Vaishnaw said during a debate on the working of the Railways Ministry in Rajya Sabha. “...passengers who had taken to roads during the pandemic have switched back to Railways... Passenger traffic is expected to touch 700 crore this year,” the minister said. Vaishnaw emphasised that Indian train fares, that have not been increased since 2020, remain the lowest compared to neighbouring countries. “In 2020 as well, the increase was 1 paisa per km in general class tickets and a little more in AC coaches. While the actual cost per kilometer stands at ₹1.38, passengers are charged only 72 paise, resulting in a total passenger subsidy of approximately ₹57,000 crore for 2023-24,” he said. “If we compare with neighboring countries, a journey of 350 km in a general class ticket costs ₹121 in India, ₹436 in Pakistan, ₹323 in Bangladesh and ₹413 in Sri Lanka. If compared with Western countries, the cost increases more than ten-fold,” he said. India will be one of the top three countries this year in the cargo handling capacity, Vaishnaw said.“By March 31 this year, Indian Railways is projected to rank among the world’s top three countries in cargo carrying capacity. India has transported 1.6 billion tonnes this year. The US and China are a little over the same numbers,” he said. Counting the work done, the minister said that around 50,000 km better quality tracks have been replaced to ensure safety. “1,400 locomotives are being manufactured in this financial year... 2 lakh wagons have been added to the entire fleet this year... 14,000 bridges have been rebuilt,” he said.He further said that the country is now exporting metro coaches to Australia; under coaches of bogies are being exported to the UK, Saudi Arabia, France, Australia; propulsion coaches are being exported to France, Mexico, Romania, Spain, Germany, Italy and passenger coaches are being exported to Mozambique, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka. “Locomotives are being exported to Mozambique, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bangladesh,” he added.There is a “laser sharp” focus on safety by introducing various technological changes, the minister informed the parliament. There has been a 91% decrease in the number of rail fractures, Vaishnaw said. “2500 rail fractures were reported in 2013-14, they have reduced to less than 250 today.”The minister said that the focus on safety has led to significant reductions in accidents. “In 2004-05 when Lalu Yadav was the railways minister, 698 accidents took place which means two accidents took place daily, on an average… When Mamata Banerjee was the railways minister, 395 accidents took place in a year, which, on an average meant that one accident took place daily,” he said.Similarly, Vaishnaw said that 381 accidents took place in a year when the leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge headed the railways ministry. “There has been a 90% reduction in railway accidents... with full responsibility I say that we should not be satisfied with this and aim to reduce it further,” Vaishnaw said. In the Lok Sabha, meanwhile, the opposition criticized the functioning of the railways ministry, saying making Instagram reels will not help the public behemoth which is on a “ventilator” due to poor management of the government. Participating in the debate on the demands for grants under the control of the ministry for 2025-26, Congress’ Varsha Gaikwad said claims that the rail budget was a “record-breaking” measure were wrong and it was, in fact, a “failed budget”.Trinamool Congress MP Satabdi Roy said no amount of compensation would bring back those killed in rail accidents. The imposition of cancellation charges on tickets was “torture” for passengers, she added.Samajwadi Party’s Lalji Verma said that Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has not increased the budget for facilities in trains.

  "articleBody": "Senior advocate Harish Salve on Monday backed the Union government’s proposal to hold simultaneous state and national elections but warned against the unrestricted power of the Election Commission as proposed in the Constitution amendment bill, people aware of developments said.Salve interacted with the joint parliamentary committee looking into the two bills that aim to usher in simultaneous elections. Former Delhi high court chief justice, justice AP Shah, however, opposed the idea of simultaneous elections and called it an attack on India’s federal structure, the people cited above added.Salve argued that things change with time and cited the example of how eminent jurist Nani Palkhiwala was opposed to the idea of the anti-defection law, but over time, it was proved that the law was required.But the eminent lawyer expressed serious concern over the power given in the proposed law to ECI, under the new, proposed Article 82A that allows the poll body to decide whether elections can be conducted or not, and also suggest President’s Rule.Salve, according to functionaries aware of the details, questioned how ECI could be given power to decide against conducting an election. On March 11, former CJI Ranjan Gogoi had voiced similar concerns, and said ECI was given “excessive power” through the contentious new article.In the Constitutional amendment bill, a new Article 82A was added, and clause (5) of that article said, “If the Election Commission is of the opinion that the elections to any legislative assembly cannot be conducted along with the general election to the House of the People, it may make a recommendation to the President, to declare by an order, that the election to that legislative assembly may be conducted at a later date.”The 39-member panel is examining the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill – which aim to usher in simultaneous polls in India – and is scheduled to complete its report by the first day of the last week of the 2025 budget session.According to functionaries present in the meeting, justice Shah was a vocal critic of the proposal – colloquially called one nation, one election – and said it would be difficult to pin accountability for a government that gets elected for the remainder of the term. As per the proposal, if a government does not complete a full five years and elections have to be held again, then the term of the new government will be for the remainder of the five years and not for the full five years. Justice Shah was opposed to this provision and said there was no precedent in any country in the world where the government gets elected only for the remainder of the term.Justice Shah maintained that the proposed amendment was a violation of the basic structure of the Constitution and that the bill will not stand the scrutiny of law, said the functionaries cited above. Shah also argued that cutting short the tenure of an assembly went against the spirit of the Kesavananda Bharati verdict that outlined the basic structure of the Constitution.The former Delhi high court chief justice maintained that re-election for the remaining term of the House if the government falls — as against a poll to constitute a new assembly–– will give voters a “half choice” and it will lead to catastrophic results.",

  "articleBody": "The Indian government is verifying the nationality of 295 people who are in the custody of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with final orders of removal, external affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar informed the Rajya Sabha in a written response on March 13. People who have been verified to be Indian citizens have only been accepted “to be deported to India”, the government said in another response.Jaishankar said that between January 2025 and March 13, a total of 388 Indians have been deported to India from the US.A total of 15,952 Indians have been deported by the US since 2009, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh informed the upper house on March 13 in another response. At 2,042, the highest number of Indians were deported in 2019.The EAM said that the Indian government does not have any “firm information” from the US government about the total number of illegal immigrants in the US with Indian passports.Jaishankar said that the MEA “strongly registered its concerns” with the US authorities about how the deportees, particularly women, were shackled in the “deportation flight” that arrived on February 5. In the deportation flights that landed in India on February 15 and 16, no women and children were restrained, the American side told India, which Indian agencies confirmed after interviewing the deportees on their arrival, Jaishankar said.Also Read | India, US negotiating trade pact that will address tariff issues: JaishankarIn response, the EAM cited a November 2012 standard operating procedure followed by ICE, which allows the authorities to use restraints on deportees. “While women and minors are generally not shackled, the flight officer in charge of a deportation flight has the final say on the matter,” the EAM’s response read.Of the 388 Indians deported by the US in 2025, 333 were directly deported from US to India on three flights (February 5, 15 and 16) while 55, who were deported between February 20 and March 2, were deported by the US via Panama on commercial flights. In another response, minister of state for external affairs Pabitra Margherita said that these 55 were not restrained.Of the 333 Indians that were deported directly to India, 126 were from Punjab, 110 from Haryana and 74 from Gujarat, Singh said in another response. Of the 55 Indian deported via Panama, 27 were from Punjab, 22 from Haryana and three from Gujarat.Also Read | Trump administration to stop using military aircraft for deportation due to high costs: ReportSingh told Parliament that the US government told MEA that detainees on the three direct flights were not instructed to remove any religious head coverings and that aside from requesting vegetarian meals, the detainees had not asked for any religious accommodations.Margherita also said that Indian Missions and Posts do not have “any reliable data” about the number of Indians that illegally stay or work in foreign countries. He said that as many countries do not give information on illegal immigrants in their countries except when “they are under orders of deportation and travel document/nationality verification is required”. He said that since all countries do not share details of all Indian deportees, “the exact number of Indian deported from foreign countries is not available”.",

  "articleBody": "Seven persons were arrested on Monday in connection with the assault on four foreigners, students of Parul University, in Waghodia area on the outskirts of Vadodara on March 14, police said.The four were assaulted by local villagers after a confrontation, reportedly over smoking cigarettes near a dargah in Limda village.“We have arrested seven persons, and further investigations are underway. Of the four injured students, the condition of the one who sustained serious injuries and collapsed on the spot is now stable,” said Rohan Anand, superintendent of police (SP) Vadodara Rural.A case was registered on a formal complaint filed by a university official on behalf of the students. Police said 10 attackers have been identified with the help of a widely-circulated video of the assault. Two of the attackers were minors and were released.According to the complaint filed at Waghodia police station, a group of around ten villagers armed with bats, sticks, and blunt objects assaulted the foreigners, who struggled to communicate as they did not understand the local language.The victims were hostelers at Parul University in Waghodia and were identified as Sufay Kangwan Ruttan from Thailand, a second-year BCA student; Odwa Andrew Abbas Andre Watari from South Sudan and Tange Evenilson Thomal from Mozambique, both first-year petroleum engineering students; and Mohammed Alikhalif Khalif Mohammed from the UK, a first-year cardiology student.The students were taking a stroll by a lake in Limda village when they were spotted smoking cigarettes near a dargah. Some local residents objected to the students smoking near the dargah but they were unable to understand Gujarati, leading to a confrontation. According to the complaint, the villagers used sticks, bats, and blunt objects - some also threw stones at the students.As the video of the attack emerged on social media, police swung into action. Parul University officials, alarmed by the incident, immediately rescued the students and shifted them to the university’s hospital.",

  "articleBody": "Maharashtra Congress president Harshvardhan Sapkal's remark comparing chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to Mughal emperor Aurangzeb sparked a massive uproar in the state council, with the ruling Mahayuti's legislators demanding strict action against him.The state legislative council witnessed chaos right after Mahayuti lawmakers raised the issue of Sapkal's remarks.On Sunday, Sapkal had said at a press conference, \"Aurangzeb was a cruel ruler. Today, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is an equally cruel ruler. He always supports issues related to religion but does nothing about cases like the murder of sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.\"BJP slams Sapkal's remarkBJP leader Pravin Darekar, while raising this issue in the House, said that comparing the chief minister, who is governing the state in an efficient manner, to Aurangzeb is \"highly condemnable\" and an insult to Maharashtra.He demanded that a case be filed against Sapkal as well as strict action be taken to set an example for others.BJP MP Bhagwat Karad also termed Sapkal's remarks against Fadnavis as \"very wrong and condemnable\". He appreciated the Maharashtra CM for doing good in the state, saying that he has good experience and is working towards a \"Viksit Maharashtra\". He called the comparison \"childish\".Additionally, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Amol Mitkari also slammed the Maharashtra Congress chief for his statement.Opposition agrees to disagreeMeanwhile, opposition leader Ambadas Danve disapproved of such personal attacks but accused the BJP-led state government of having an \"Aurangzeb-like mentality\".NCP(SP) leader Shashikant Shinde also voiced a similar view. His colleague Rohit Pawar as well, noted that comparing anyone to an individual like Aurangzeb \"to some extent is not good\".\"Politically, we should fight against all opposition...maybe the state Congress president meant something else by what he said. He must have said it because of the way this government is working,\" Pawar said.However, Congress leader Bhai Jagtap dismissed the allegations and claimed that Sapkal never made such a statement.State revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule assured the House that the government would seriously consider strict action against Sapkal for his \"objectionable\" remarks.(with PTI inputs)",

  "articleBody": "The Union government has taken note of recent developments concerning the activities and funding of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the ministry of external affairs (MEA) informed Rajya Sabha on Monday.In a written response, the ministry stated that it has formally requested for the details from the US administration regarding expenditures incurred on USAID-funded projects in India over the past decade.The response came in reply to questions raised by Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas, who referred to reports, which alleged that the USAID funds were used to influence voter turnout in Indian elections. The controversy gained momentum after the Elon Musk-led US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) announced budget cuts for USAID on February 16, including a contentious $21 million allegedly allocated for voter mobilisation efforts in India. The issue further escalated with repeated claims by US President Donald Trump that his predecessor, Joe Biden, sanctioned funds to interfere in India’s electoral process.Also Read | USAID cancels 83 percent of contracts for not meeting Washington's interest, says Marco Rubio“In view of the recent reports regards USAID funding in India, the ministry of external affairs has formally asked the US Embassy to urgently furnish details of expenditure incurred on all USAID assisted/funded projects in India over the last 10 years,” the ministry said in its response to Brittas.The government has also sought information on the NGOs involved in implementing USAID-backed initiatives. However, it noted that no official response has been provided by the US side so far. “While there is some open-source information available on this matter, the Government of India understandably expects an official response from the US Government on this matter,” the statement added.The MEA further highlighted that certain details about USAID beneficiaries have been withheld by the US administration, citing legal provisions under American law that allow “exceptional redactions.” “As per that legislation, the exceptional redactions include information that would jeopardise the health or security of an implementing partner or programme beneficiary. Another justification is a determination that the information online would be detrimental to the national interests of the United States,” the ministry noted.Amid the controversy, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated on February 21 that President Trump’s claim regarding the $21 million was “very deeply troubling.” He added that it has “raised concerns about foreign interference in India’s internal affairs.” The following day, on February 22, external affairs minister S Jaishankar mentioned that the government was investigating the matter and assured that “the facts will come out soon.”Also Read | ‘15 minutes to clear out workstations’: Notice to fired, on leave USAID staffers“The USAID was allowed to operate here in good faith to undertake positive activities. However, suggestions are emerging from America that there are actions being taken in bad faith,” the EAM remarked at a public event.Additionally, the annual report by the Union finance ministry’s department of economic affairs indicated that a total of seven projects, worth $750 million, were being jointly implemented by USAID and the Union government for the fiscal year 2023-24. These projects are focused on various sectors, including agriculture, food security, climate adaptation, water, sanitation, renewable energy, health, disaster management and energy efficiency technology.",

  "articleBody": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that while the right to clean environment is a guaranteed fundamental right under the Indian Constitution, the right to development through industrialisation holds equal priority. The court underscored the need for sustainable development that harmonises these two rights, striking a “golden balance” between environmental protection and economic progress.“While the right to clean environment is a guaranteed fundamental right under Articles 14 (equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution of India, the right to development through industrialisation equally claims priority under fundamental rights, particularly under Articles 14, 19 (right to engage in any profession, occupation, trade or business) and 21 of the Constitution of India,” held a bench of justices Bela M Trivedi and PB Varale.The top court made these observations while setting aside an April 2022 order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that had barred the Auroville Foundation from carrying out developmental activities in its township in Puducherry.The bench highlighted that economic growth and environmental conservation are not mutually exclusive, drawing from past jurisprudence. “Sustainable development has been accepted as a viable concept to eradicate poverty and improve the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems,” noted the bench.Holding that the principle is now a recognised part of customary international law, it further cited the Brundtland Report, defining sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”The case arose after residents of Auroville approached the NGT, alleging that the Auroville Foundation’s road construction—particularly the Crown Road and Outer Ring Road—was destroying a forested area known as the Darkali Forest. The NGT had directed the foundation to prepare a revised township plan, obtain environmental clearance, and halt construction until then.However, the Supreme Court held that NGT had overstepped its jurisdiction. The judgment noted that the Master Plan for Auroville, which included the contested roads, had been approved by the competent authorities as early as 2001 and notified in 2010.“The Tribunal has completely misdirected itself by entering into the restricted domain of judicial review under the guise of applying the ‘Precautionary Principle’ in extraordinary circumstances and interfering with the implementation of the Master Plan,” said the bench.The court also pointed out that there was no substantive evidence to establish that the Darkali Forest qualified as a deemed forest under the law. It cited the NGT’s own finding that the area was a man-made plantation and was never recorded as a forest in government documents.While NGT had justified its directions under the “precautionary principle,” the bench found this approach inappropriate, especially in the absence of a proven violation of environmental laws.The judgment criticised the NGT for imposing additional requirements, such as obtaining environmental clearance for further activities and mandating a Joint Committee inspection to consider modifications in road width to minimise tree-cutting. The bench held that these directions fell outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, especially when the Ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) had already clarified that the Auroville Township project predated the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 1994, and thus did not require fresh clearance.Through a separate judgment, the same bench also struck down a Madras high court order in March 2024 that quashed a standing order issued by the Auroville governing board replacing the Auroville Town Development Council (ATDC) with an advisory group for implementing the master plan. The court noted that the Auroville Foundation Act and the rules vested the governing board with all the power to issue standing orders for the implementation of the Master Plan that stood approved in 2001 and for the development of Auroville as planned. The bench also imposed a cost of ₹50,000 on the petitioner who had assailed the 2022 standing order in the high court, lamenting that it was a motivated petition to “hamper the development of Auroville and to cause obstructions in the smooth functioning of the governing board”.

  "articleBody": "New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Parliament (MP) Samik Bhattacharya on Monday demanded that expelled Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin should be allowed to return to Kolkata, which she left in 2007 amid widespread protests against her literary work.“Taslima Nasrin wants to come back to Kolkata. This city is like a city of life to her. She wants to compose her work in Bengali,” Bhattacharya said during a Zero Hour discussion in Rajya Sabha. The BJP leader’s statement comes in the backdrop of Nasrin alleging that the West Bengal government had suppressed artistic expression by preventing the staging of a theatrical adaptation of her book ‘Lajja’. She claimed that her writings remain a target of political appeasement and that her voice is being silenced in the name of maintaining communal harmony. However, West Bengal police dismissed these claims, asserting that no official orders were issued to stop the play from being performed. The BJP MP mentioned Nasirn’s novel, Lajja, which features the atrocities faced by a Hindu family in Bangladesh in the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition, and criticised the Communist Party of India (Marxist), who was in power in West Bengal when the Bangladeshi writer left. “During the International Women’s Day, they talked about (Marxist theorists) Rosa Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin, but they didn’t utter a single word about Taslima Nasrin,” Bhattacharya said. Reacting to the MP’s remark, Taslima Nasreen thanked him and said she was exiled from her homeland for standing up for human rights.“I am grateful and thankful to him for realising how important it is for me to live in the Bengali environment of West Bengal if I want to continue writing in Bengali,” she said in a post on Facebook.Taslima Nasrin, who had been living in exile in India since 1994, was forced to leave Kolkata in 2007 following violent protests by Islamist groups over her writings. Her book ‘Dwikhandito’ and several of her statements were deemed controversial, leading to demonstrations that turned violent. The unrest escalated to the point that the state government advised her to leave for her safety. She was later relocated to Jaipur and then Delhi under government protection before eventually leaving India. Over the years, Nasrin has repeatedly expressed her desire to return to Kolkata, which she considers home. However, successive governments in West Bengal have not facilitated her return, citing security concerns. While her presence in India remains a politically sensitive issue, her appeal to return continues to find support among sections of the literary and political communities. ",

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, The top brass of the Delhi Police held a meeting on Monday to discuss the progress of the force's efforts to combat organised crime and crack down on foreign-based gangsters operating in the national capital, police sources said. The meeting was chaired by the Special CPs and attended by Joint CPs, Additional CPs, and DCPs from all 15 districts and three units , who directed officials to reduce the crime graph in the national capital and held discussions on various topics, including foreign-based gangsters, law and order and narcotics. The next such review meeting will take place on March 31. \"During the meeting, officers reviewed the work done in the last 15 days and set targets for the coming 15 days,\" said a source. \"All of these gangsters are foreign-based and are operating in the national capital through online means. We discussed how these gangsters are recruiting minors into their gangs with the help of their jailed associates. The Special Cell will keep a strict vigil on every single activity of the gangsters, including their social media profiles. Teams are already closely monitoring minors associated with gangsters who have committed crimes,\" said a senior police officer, who requested anonymity. The officer further stated that a high-level meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah was organized last month, during which the Delhi Police prepared a comprehensive list of gangsters and ordered strict surveillance on them. The police have also compiled a list of emerging gangsters. \"Those who are assisting gangsters will also be on the police radar. Their activities will be monitored as well,\" he said. The top brass also directed officials to increase night patrolling, foot patrolling, and patrolling in public places like railway stations and malls. Another police officer stated that, as part of the new robust security measures, the Delhi Police will also work to dismantle national and international drug supply chains and combat mobile theft, with stolen phones being sold in countries like Bangladesh and Nepal. During the meeting with the Union Home Minister, the minister directed officials to arrest those responsible for drug supply in the national capital. \"Action must be taken using both top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top approaches in narcotics cases, and such drug networks should be dismantled,\" he said. The officer also mentioned that, in the last three months, the police have arrested more than a dozen people involved in mobile snatching gangs. These gangs would sell stolen mobile phones to middlemen, who then smuggled them into Bangladesh and Nepal’s gray market. The meeting lasted 40 minutes, during which police also discussed breaking the chain of arms syndicates and suppliers. Ensuring the security of elders and children will also be a priority for the Delhi Police. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.",

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Centre to respond to a plea of civil society organisation Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative challenging the cancellation of its FCRA registration. Justice Sachin Datta issued a notice on the petition and granted time to the authorities for the reply. The petitioner sought an interim stay in the matter, but the court posted the matter in April. The plea said the Centre, without providing an opportunity to the petitioner to be heard, cancelled its certificate of registration on September 12, 2024 in violation of the principles of natural justice aside from its statutory and fundamental rights. The registration of the petitioner’s registration was suspended by the Centre in June, 2021. The cancellation order, the petition said, was unreasonable, unreasoned, vague, without any application of mind and based on wholly incorrect facts, and that the allegation of violation of Foreign Contribution Act against it was misconceived. The plea claimed the order was based on certain reports of the central security agency and other inputs available with the ministry not within its knowledge. The authorities, the plea alleged, failed to establish that CHRI was \"guilty of diversion or misutilisation of its funds\" and argued foreign contributions were utilised for the purpose it was granted and not diverted or misused. \"In the absence of such a finding, and neither any law/policy restricting the utilisation of foreign contribution abroad, nor any establishment by the respondent for diversion/misutilisation of funds, prima facie, there is no case for cancellation of petitioner's certificate of registration on the ground that foreign contribution was diverted or misutilised,\" the plea said. The action was disproportionate as the authorities failed to prove how the cancellation of registration served to protect or further national interest, it added. Saying the violations were alleged after an \"undue delay\", i.e., in 2021 the petitioner sought permission from court to access its bank accounts as it was gravely affecting its welfare activities. \"Since the suspension order, petitioner's receipt and utilisation bank accounts stand frozen. This has severely restricted petitioner's programmes and activities. Therefore, the petitioner is now not in a position to pay salaries to all of its staff members and consultants, whose livelihoods depend on it,\" CHRI said.

  "articleBody": " Tamil Nadu’s principal opposition AIADMK’s no-confidence motion on Monday seeking to remove assembly speaker M Appavu was defeated, with 154 MLAs from the ruling DMK and its allies including the Congress against it in a voice vote. AIADMK’s 63 MLAs supported it. The BJP and its ally PMK skipped both the discussion on the resolution and the voting process. The AIADMK had moved the resolution charging that the speaker is biased and “acting like a DMK worker” inside the House and wanted him removed from the position. Chief minister and DMK president M K Stalin reacted that people would “laugh” at such a resolution. But even the AIADMK leaders who were expelled by party chief and leader of opposition Edappadi Palaniswami (EPS) –O Panneerselvam (OPS) R Vaithilingam, Manoj Pandian—supported the resolution. EPS listed various instances where he said the Speaker had acted partially such as not allowing opposition MLAs to complete their speeches. “Is this democracy?” EPS asked. “The House is for discussing people’s issues. The Speaker is posing an obstacle to speak on the failures of the ruling party and people’s problems. On whose command is he acting?” EPS also accused the Speaker of blacking out opposition members in recording of House proceedings by not showing them when they were wearing blackshirts. “The speaker has always been impartial,” Stalin said. “He has given opportunities to opposition members generously. He acts without our government or party’s influence… We must not debate if this resolution is to divert attention from confusion within the AIADMK, or if this resolution is taken up by them as there is nothing to find fault with the government. Let others outside debate it.”After the discussion, deputy speaker K Pitchandi conducted a voice vote and declared that AIADMK’s resolution was defeated. Following the announcement, the speaker resumed his position on the chair. “I am more happy on this day than when I was elected as the speaker,” Appavu said. “I have always maintained impartiality while performing his duties in the House.”",

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, Union Minister of State for Health Anupriya Patel on Monday said India's digital disease surveillance system offers a valuable model for other countries seeking to strengthen their public health infrastructure. The rise of emerging and re-emerging health threats in recent times underscores the critical necessity of strengthened preparedness, enhanced surveillance and well-coordinated international response mechanisms to safeguard global health security, Patel said after inaugurating the QUAD Workshop on Pandemic Preparedness for the Indo-Pacific Region here. The purpose of the three-day workshop, jointly organised by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of External Affairs, is to strengthen global health emergency frameworks, enhance preparedness and resilience to health threats, ensure coordinated responses to evolving pandemics, implementation of One Health approach, and address human, animal and environmental health through a multisectoral lens. Highlighting India's commitment to strengthening global pandemic preparedness and response efforts, Patel said, \"India has contributed USD 10 million towards the establishment of Pandemic Fund which was specially conceptualised for fighting pandemics.\" \"India has further pledged an additional USD 12 million to support its sustained functioning,\" she added. Patel said India has led digital health initiatives, leveraging technology to improve health access and outcomes, and create sustainable and data-driven systems. These efforts are central to building a health system capable of addressing both current as well as future health and climate challenges, she said. The minister said India has established a comprehensive health emergency coordination framework, strategically focused on preparedness, response and resilience-building through setting up several key initiatives within the healthcare system towards the vision of creating and stabilising a resilient and pandemic-ready healthcare system. She cited Integrated Disease Surveillance Program , National One Health Programme for Prevention and Control of Zoonosis and National Vector Borne Disease Control and Prevention among others. The Union minister highlighted that India's harnessing of digital technology in healthcare through initiatives like the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and tools like the CoWIN platform, eSanjeevani, National Telemedicine Service, Tele-MANAS to manage mental health diseases and the Ni-Kshay portal for tracking monitoring and management of tuberculosis patients. \"Our robust digital disease surveillance system offers a valuable model for other countries seeking to strengthen their public health infrastructure,\" she added. Patel said India as a lighthouse country in digital health technologies has been at the forefront of deliberations across various international forums. \"India is keen to share our Digital Public Infrastructures with the global community, especially with our friends in the Global South to enable modern healthcare approaches. We are also willing to offer courses and capacity-building training in partnership with our MEA in identified areas of interest in the health sector,\" she further stated. She concluded her address by emphasising the importance of unity and collaboration in health initiatives to ensure \"a safer and healthier future for all\".

  "articleBody": "New Delhi: Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu on Monday told Parliament that the ministry was investigating a complaint against Air India for failing to provide a pre-booked wheelchair to an 82-year-old woman passenger at Delhi airport recently. The minister also said that a show cause notice will be issued to Air India for not providing a wheelchair to the passenger. “We are conducting a detailed inquiry to understand exactly what transpired,” Naidu said.Responding to supplementary questions during the Rajya Sabha’s question hour, the minister said that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had separately spoken to both the passenger’s family and the airline and that it was reviewing CCTV footage to determine the exact sequence of events. Describing the incident as very unfortunate, Naidu said that the ministry had promptly taken notice and is thoroughly investigating the matter.“There are always two sides to a story, one from the family, and the DGCA has gathered the family’s account, and another from the airline. We will issue a show-cause notice to the airline and take appropriate action based on the findings. The CCTV footage will help us clarify the situation. I assure the members that we are looking into the issue,” he said. The incident, which occurred on March 4, involved an elderly passenger falling at the airport after not receiving a pre-booked wheelchair. Air India, however, in its detailed statement issued on March 8, maintained that the passenger was never denied wheelchair assistance and received first aid immediately.",

  "articleBody": "Bangladesh has rejected US Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard’s remarks on the “persecution and killing” of Hindus and religious minorities in the country, saying such comments are baseless and not based on evidence. The strong reaction from Dhaka to the remarks made by Gabbard in an interview with an Indian television channel on Monday also reflected the strains in relations between the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and the Donald Trump administration in the US. Gabbard said in an interview with NDTV that the persecution and killing of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh is a concern for the Trump administration. Her remarks appeared to conflate the situation in Bangladesh with the Trump administration’s plans to tackle “Islamist terrorism” across the globe. Bangladesh’s interim government expressed “deep concern and distress” at Gabbard’s remarks, especially her allegations about the “persecution and killing” of religious minorities and “the threat of Islamic terrorists” rooted in the “ideology and objective” to “rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate”. “Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of ‘Islamist caliphate’,” the interim government said in a statement. These remarks are “misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism”, the statement said. “Gabbard’s comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations. They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush.” “Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges of extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts.” Linking Bangladesh to the idea of an “Islamist caliphate” undermines the work of countless Bangladeshis and their friends and partners around the world committed to peace, stability, and progress, it said. The interim government said political leaders should base their statements, especially on sensitive issues, on “actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions”. The interim government also said it will engage in “constructive dialogue based on facts and on respect for the sovereignty and security of all nations” on shared global efforts to combat extremism and terrorism. Gabbard is in India to attend a conclave of security and intelligence officials and participate in the Raisina Dialogue, where she will deliver an address on Tuesday. She is the first senior member of the Trump administration to travel to India. “The long-time unfortunate persecution and killing and abuse of religious minorities – Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Catholics, and others – has been a major area of concern for the US government and President Trump and his administration,” she told NDTV. Talks are “just beginning” between Trump’s new cabinet and the Bangladesh government, and the “threat of Islamist terrorists” is a central area of focus for the US, she said. Her comments came against the backdrop of India expressing concern about Bangladesh’s interim government failing to prevent the targeting of the country’s minorities and the rise of extremist elements.

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a plea against an order of the Gauhati High Court which adjourned sine die a case over the protection and preservation of Kaziranga National Park. A bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih said the issues relating to the park, including the declaration of eco-sensitive zone, was pending before the apex court. The bench told the petitioner's counsel to withdraw the plea challenging the high court order and file an application in the proceedings pending before the top court. The counsel withdrew the plea with liberty to move an appropriate plea in the apex court. The petitioner's counsel said the plea filed before the high court raised several issues concerning the park, including the declaration of eco-sensitive zone. \"That issue is pending before this court,\" the bench observed. In its order passed on December 6 last year, the high court adjourned the matter sine die observing several issues relating to the national park were pending before the apex court. The PIL filed in the high court raised several issues concerning the protection of bio-diversity and ecosystem of Kaziranga National Park including eco-fragile zone, protection of nine notified animal corridors and for action against alleged unauthorised industrial and other non-forest activity. The petitioner alleged non-forest activity, including settlement of land within the forest area, had ramifications and referred to a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India stating a change in land pattern and other non-forest activities might wipe out the one-horned rhino to extinction. While adjourning the matter sine die, the high court noted no material was brought before it to show that the issue relating to eco-sensitive zone with respect to Assam in general and for the Kaziranga National Park in particular was finally decided by the Supreme Court. Aside from the rhinoceros, the park's elephant grass, marshland and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests are home to hoolock gibbon, tiger, leopard, Indian elephants, sloth bear, wild water buffalo and swamp deer.

  "articleBody": "The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Monday decided to wait and see if the central government notifies the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules before proceeding with the appeals filed by Meta and WhatsApp against a 2024 order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) that imposed ₹213.14 crore penalty on Meta for abuse of dominance. Along with the penalty, CCI had prohibited WhatsApp from sharing user data with Meta for a period of five years. Meta and WhatsApp challenged this order before NCLAT, which in January 2025 granted a partial stay on both the financial penalty and the restriction on data sharing.A tribunal bench, led by NCLAT chairperson justice Ashok Bhushan, deferred the hearing after Meta submitted that the Centre was likely to notify the rules by the middle of the year, potentially impacting the case. The bench, also comprising technical member Arun Baroka, observed that the outcome of the DPDP Rules could have a bearing on the case and deemed it appropriate to delay proceedings to avoid any “overlap” with the forthcoming regulations.“The whole issue might be covered by the new Rules. There is no harm in waiting until the next date. We can decide on the next date whether the appeal should be heard or not,” the tribunal remarked while adjourning the matter to May 13.Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, representing Meta, said the Union government already released the draft DPDP Rules and the process of consultation was going on. He said that he could check with the ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) and inform the bench of the date by which the Rules were likely to be notified.Sibal’s request was opposed by CCI, whose counsel argued that the matter involved urgency and that a request for such deferment was unfair for it will allow Meta and WhatsApp to “enjoy the benefits” of NCLAT’s interim order that stayed the five-year ban imposed by CCI on data-sharing practices between WhatsApp and Meta for advertising purposes.The dispute arises from a January 2021 notification issued by WhatsApp informing users about its revised terms of service and privacy policies. The new policy stated that effective February 8 the same year, users were required to accept all terms, including an expanded scope of data collection as well as mandatory data sharing with Meta companies, to continue using WhatsApp.CCI took suo motu cognisance of the issue and concluded that the 2021 policy update constituted an imposition of “unfair condition” under the Companies Act since it compelled users to accept the data collection and sharing terms.Last November, CCI imposed a penalty of ₹213.14 crore on Meta for abusing its dominant position, and prohibited WhatsApp from sharing user data collected on its platform with other Meta companies and Meta company products for advertising purposes for five years. NCLAT stayed the five-year ban this January while directing Meta to deposit 50% of the penalty amount.",

  "articleBody": " Bijapur, At least 19 Naxalites, nine of them carrying a cumulative bounty of ₹28 lakh, surrendered before security forces in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur district on Monday, a senior police official said. The cadres, including a couple, turned themselves in before senior officials of the police and Central Reserve Police Force , citing disappointment with \"hollow\" and \"inhuman\" Maoist ideology, exploitation of innocent tribals by senior cadres and differences brewing within the outlawed outfit, Bijapur Senior Superintendent of Police Jitendra Kumar Yadav said. He said that they were also impressed with the increasing influence of the security forces, with the setting up of camps and the 'Niya Nellanar' scheme, under which the authorities have been making efforts to provide basic amenities and carrying out development works in interior areas. Yadav said all the surrendered Naxalites were active in different capacities in the Andhra Odisha Border division and Pamed area committee of Maoists. Of the surrendered cadres, Deva Padam and his wife Dule Kalmu were active as senior members in Battalion no. 1 of Maoists and carried a reward of ₹8 lakh each, he said. The official said Suresh Kattam , an area committee member, carried a reward of ₹5 lakh, while one of the surrendered cadres had a bounty of ₹2 lakh, and five others were carrying rewards of ₹1 lakh each. He said the District Reserve Guard , Bastar Fighters, Special Task Force , CRPF and its elite unit CoBRA played a key role in their surrender. All the surrendered Naxalites were provided assistance of ₹25,000 each and will be rehabilitated as per the government's policy, the official added. With this, 84 Naxalites have surrendered in Bijapur district of the Bastar range so far this year. Last year, 792 Naxalites had surrendered in the Bastar region, comprising seven districts.

  "articleBody": "The Supreme Court on Monday underlined the need to have trust in constitutional institutions , expressing concerns over entertaining a fresh petition seeking a “neutral” selection committee, headed by Prime Minister with Chief Justice of India (CJI) as one of the members, to recommend appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), although it eventually issued notice on the petition and sought the response of the Centre.A bench headed by justice Surya Kant said, “Where the Constitution provides unconditional power for appointment of a constitutional authority, it needs to be examined to what extent can the Supreme Court rewrite the Constitution.”The court was hearing a petition filed by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) which raised questions on the transparent and independent functioning of CAG, the audit watchdog for public expenditure, and sought a three-member selection committee having Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition and CJI to recommend appointment of CAG to the President of India.Also Read | Too many chinks in Delhi pollution fight: CAGThe court issued notice on the petition and sought response of the Centre after being told that the same issue is already pending before the top court in a PIL filed by former deputy CAG Anupam Kulshreshtha and others seeking a similar independent committee headed by PM to recommend the appointment of CAG. The bench directed the CPIL case to be tagged with Kulshreshtha’s petition.Advocate Prashant Bhushan appearing for CPIL said that the issue of safeguards against removal of constitutional authorities has never been a bar against courts from entertaining petitions to devise a new scheme for appointment in the interest securing transparency and fairness in the functioning of these authorities. He cited the 2023 judgment by a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court proposing a three-member committee having PM, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, and CJI or his nominee to recommend the appointment of chief election commissioner (CEC) and election commissioners.The bench, also comprising justice Ujjal Bhuyan said, “We have to trust our institutions.” It distinguished the judgment on CEC appointment and said, “There is a vast difference between the manner of appointing CEC. Article 324 of Constitution (dealing with CEC appointment) says that the appointment is subject to law made by Parliament.”Also Read | CEC Gyanesh Kumar asks poll officials to hold all party meetings, resolve issuesThe Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023 was enacted by the Centre in December 2023 to replace Chief Justice of India (CJI) from the selection committee proposed by the Constitution bench as one of the members. Instead, the law proposed having a Union Cabinet minister to be nominated by the PM. The challenge to the law is pending before the top court in a clutch of petitions. The petitions have alleged that replacing CJI in the selection committee fails to preserve free and fair elections that forms part of the basic structure of the Constitution The court referred to Article 148 of the Constitution of India dealing with the appointment of CAG that says CAG shall be appointed by the President and shall be removed from office in the like manner and on the like grounds as a judge of the Supreme Court.“We need to have the wider aspect in mind. These appointments are by President. Sometimes, we have a misconception about the independence part. Once appointed to the posts, constitutional protection is there...Twice, this court has rejected petitions for removal of CAG.”Bhushan pointed out that the issue of CAG appointment was never discussed in any of the earlier decisions by the top court. On the pending petition by Kulshreshtha, it was pointed out that notice was issued by the top court in January 2024 and the Centre is yet to file its response.The petition said, “The present mode of appointment of CAG, which is done solely by the executive i.e. by the Prime Minister who handpicks any individual and recommends his name to the President for appointment, is unconstitutional as it is violative of Article 14 and several basic features of the Constitution of India.”It further stated that the CAG acts as a “watchdog” over government accounts and expenditure and plays an important role in ensuring transparency and financial accountability in the functioning of the Central and state governments as well as Panchayati Raj institutions.Unfortunately, Bhushan said, “Despite the Constitution’s best intent to keep the office of the CAG independent from any executive interference, it is increasingly witnessing political interference.” When the court asked Bhushan to suggest what “deviations” have been noticed in the functioning of CAG, Bhushan cited news reports suggesting “steady decline” in the number of CAG audits on the Union government as only 18 reports were tabled in Parliament in 2023.The court said it is possible that reports may have been prepared by CAG but the same were not tabled in Parliament.Bhushan cited the statement made by BR Ambedkar at the time of framing of the Constitution proposing CAG to have far greater independence than the judiciary. This proposal was not accepted by the majority in the Constituent Assembly.As the petitioner sought an early date of hearing citing the issue to be “urgent”, the court said it needs to ascertain if there is any direction in the Kulshreshtha matter requiring a three-judge bench to hear the case. While Bhushan submitted the issue may ultimately have to be heard by a constitution bench, the court refrained from making any comment. As per the information updated on the portal, the matter is tentatively listed for hearing on May 6.",

  "articleBody": "After violence erupted in Maharashtra's Nagpur on Monday amid rumours of burning of a holy book, authorities have reportedly issued curfew orders for several areas as the city police commissioner assured the residents that the situation was under control.According to the news agency ANI, a curfew has been imposed in the limits of several police stations in Nagpur city. These police stations include Kotwali, Ganeshpeth, Lakadganj, Pachpaoali, and Shantinagar. Curfew has also been imposed in Sakkardara, Nandanvan, Imamwada, Yashodhara Nagar, and Kapil Nagar police stations.According to Nagpur police commissioner Dr Ravinder Kumar Singal, the curfew will remain in force until further orders.Maharashtra Minority Commission chairman Pyare Khan has termed the recent violence in Nagpur as \"very unfortunate,\" urged people to maintain peace, and claimed that those responsible were not locals but outsiders who came to create unrest in a city known for its communal harmony.\"This is a very unfortunate incident, and such violence should not have happened in Nagpur, a place known for its saints. During Ram Navami, Muslims here set up tents to welcome Hindus. There is a Dargah where people from all religions--Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians--come to pray,\" Khan was quoted by ANI as saying.He alleged that the violence was caused by anti-social elements from outside the city.\"The people involved in this violence are not from Nagpur. Some anti-social elements came from outside and created unrest,\" he claimed.Why did the violence erupt in Nagpur?Violence erupted in central Nagpur in the Chitnis Park area in Mahal on Monday around 7.30 pm with stones hurled at police amid rumours that the holy book of a community was burnt during an agitation by a right-wing body for the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb, leaving six persons and some policemen injured, news agency PTI reported.Police arrested 15 persons during combing operations in various localities in the Mahal area.Another clash broke out in the Hansapuri area near the Old Bhandara Road between 10:30 pm to 11:30 pm. An unruly mob burnt several vehicles, and vandalised houses and a clinic in the area.Some of the residents came out in their galleries and watched as a posse of cops led by senior officers marched into the lanes.A resident of the Hansapuri told PTI that the mob came to their home at around 10.30 pm and burnt their vehicles parked outside the house and a fire also broke out as they torched vehicles and properties.Another eyewitness said that the mob had covered their faces and broke the CCTV camera.

  "articleBody": "New Delhi: India and New Zealand on Monday firmed up an agreement to bolster defence cooperation with an eye on ensuring an open and stable Indo-Pacific, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged New Delhi’s concerns about activities of pro-Khalistan elements to his counterpart Christopher Luxon. The two countries announced the formal launch of negotiations on a free trade agreement and a pact for mobility of professionals and skilled workers, and unveiled a range of measures, from cooperation in digital payments to an arrangement for easier movement of goods, to enhance two-way trade from the current level of about $1.8 billion. “We have decided to strengthen and institutionalise our defence and security partnership. Along with joint exercises, training and port visits, a roadmap will be made for cooperation in the defence industry,” Modi told a joint media interaction after his talks with Luxon. “Our navies are working together in Combined Task Force-150 for maritime security in the Indian Ocean,” he said, speaking in Hindi. India and New Zealand support a free, open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific and believe in the “policy of development, not expansionism”, Modi said against the backdrop of concerns over China’s aggressive behaviour across the region. Luxon said the two sides discussed ways to cope with the “challenging strategic outlook” in the Indo-Pacific. “I reiterated New Zealand’s strong commitment to working with India to address shared concerns over our respective interests and contributions to ensure a strong, stable and prosperous region,” he said. The MoU on defence cooperation, described by Indian officials as a large omnibus pact, will establish regular engagements such as joint training and ship visits. The two sides already have an agreement for exchanging information on white shipping, and India is part of Command Task Force-150, a multi-national unit currently led by New Zealand, which protects trade routes and counters piracy and terror in the Indian Ocean. As part of the discussions on security cooperation, the Indian side raised anti-India activities of pro-Khalistan elements in New Zealand, officials said. As in the case of Canada, the UK and the US, these elements have organised anti-India protests and sought to target Indian diplomats, albeit on a smaller scale. Modi said both countries are unanimous in opposing terrorism, whether it is the Christchurch terror attack of March 2019 or the Mumbai attacks of November 2008, and strict action should be taken against those guilty. “We will continue to cooperate against terrorist, separatist and radical elements. In this context, we shared our concerns about anti-India activities by some illegal elements in New Zealand. We are confident that we will continue to get the cooperation of the New Zealand government against all these illegal elements,” he said. Secretary (East) in the external affairs ministry, Jaideep Mazumdar, told a media briefing that the Indian side alerts “friends to the activities of anti-India elements in their countries” and the abuse of democratic freedoms to “glorify terrorism and to threaten attacks against our diplomats”. New Delhi’s concerns were flagged at the meeting, and the New Zealand government “has been receptive” in the past. “This was also the reaction that we got today,” Mazumdar said. In the field of trade and commerce, the two sides announced the launch of negotiations for a free trade agreement (FTA) and an arrangement for the mobility of professionals. Modi said a mutually beneficial FTA will boost the potential of trade and investment and encourage cooperation in dairy, food processing and pharmaceuticals. While Mazumdar noted the two countries hoped to conclude the FTA by the end of the year, a joint statement said the agreement can foster trade and investment by “leveraging each country’s strengths, addressing their respective concerns, and tackling challenges”. The proposed arrangement for mobility of professionals will also address the issue of irregular migration, the joint statement said. The two sides encouraged the creation of opportunities for Indian students in New Zealand and pointed to the importance of mobility of skilled personnel to support engagement in sectors such as innovation and emerging technologies. The joint statement pointed to other measures to bolster trade, such as discussions for cooperation in digital payments, and the signing of the “Authorized Economic Operators Mutual Recognition Arrangement”, which will facilitate easier movement of goods through trusted traders and close cooperation between customs authorities. The two sides also signed a memorandum of cooperation on horticulture to develop post-harvest and marketing infrastructure, a letter of intent on forestry cooperation, an education cooperation agreement, and a memorandum of cooperation in sports. With more than 150,000 Indian tourists visiting New Zealand and 72,000 New Zealand tourists travelling to the country last year, the two sides agreed to encourage their carriers to begin direct flights. Besides reaffirming support for an open, inclusive, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific “where sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected”, the joint statement expressed firm support for peace and stability in the Middle East. The two leaders called for negotiations to secure a permanent peace, which includes releasing all hostages and rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access throughout Gaza. The joint statement stressed the importance of a two-state solution, leading to establishment of a sovereign, viable and independent state of Palestine. Modi and Luxon also discussed the war in Ukraine and expressed support for a just and lasting peace based on respect for international law and territorial integrity and sovereignty. “The two leaders reiterated their absolute condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and the use of terrorist proxies in cross-border terrorism,” the joint statement said.

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, A parliamentary standing committee has highlighted the need to resolve bottlenecks in medical assessments of people with disabilities and recommended the inclusion of private medical professionals to expedite their certification. The Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment, in its report tabled in Parliament on Monday, raised concerns over significant delays in the disability certification process. The Committee noted that while the UDID project has successfully generated approximately 1.18 crore cards, its implementation continues to face challenges due to a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate hospital infrastructure and a large backlog of pending applications at hospitals. \"To address these issues, the Committee recommend that the Department work in close coordination with state governments to strengthen medical infrastructure, expedite the inclusion of private medical professionals in the certification process, and ensure the availability of well-equipped facilities for disability assessment,\" the panel said. The panel said the Department of Disability Affairs should facilitate specialised training programmes for medical authorities to improve efficiency in issuing disability certificates and reduce delays. The panel said the Department of Disability Affairs has struggled with fund utilisation in previous years. In 2024-25, the department spent only ₹892.68 crore of the revised estimate of ₹1167.27 crore, a utilisation rate of 76.48 per cent. This shortfall was attributed by the panel to disruptions caused by new financial models and delays in receiving utilisation certificates from state governments. Despite positive initiatives, the committee said, there has been a persistent underutilisation of funds in key programmes. For example, the Scheme for Implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act has faced significant budget cuts and spending inconsistencies. In 2024-25, only ₹43.90 crore of the revised ₹111 crore was utilised. To address these challenges, the committee has called for targeted remedial measures, including better engagement with state governments and NGOs. It also urged the department to streamline administrative processes, expedite fund disbursement and improve monitoring systems through digital platforms like the ADIP &amp; RVY Joint Interface for Unique Nomination portal. The committee has recommended simplifying application processes and integrating AI-based verification to ensure timely disbursal of funds to eligible students. The Standing Committee praised the department’s proactive measures but stressed the need for sustained collaboration between the central and state governments. It called for the institutionalisation of successful models like Karnataka’s village-level workers and a structured framework to document and replicate best practices nationwide.

  "articleBody": " Patna, JD leader Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha on Monday voiced disapproval of the clamour in the party for bringing Nishant, the son of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, into active politics. Speaking to reporters here, the member of the state legislative council also said that if the 47 years old was handed over the reins of JD, \"there will be no difference\" between Nitish Kumar, the party's national president, and his arch rival Lalu Prasad, the RJD president. \"I have never ever seen any prominent leader of the party, including the spokespersons, having ever said anything about Nishant. The noise is mostly in the media,\" Kushwaha said. He was replying to queries about the celebrations at the chief minister's residence on Holi, when Nishant was the cynosure of all eyes, with top party leaders making a beeline to get photographed with the engineering graduate who is, of late, being viewed as the heir apparent to his father. The development seems to have enthused the party cadre, who put up a poster at the JD office, offering \"thanks\" to Nishant \"for heeding the voice of Bihar\" by making it apparent that his political entry was \"just a matter of days\". However, Kushwaha disagreed with the perception, asserting, \"I too had gone to the CM's house but I greeted Nitish Kumar. I made no attempts to get cosy with Nishant.\" To a pointed query as to whether he was in favour of Nishant's political entry or not, Kushwaha, who has been in and out of the party despite being a founding member, said, \"Of what avail is my wish? It is the writ of Nitish Kumar that shall run in the JD.\" He, however, bristled at speculations in a section of the media that upon entering politics, Nishant may replace his father, now on the wrong side of 70, as the JD national president. \"If such a thing happens\", said Kushwaha, \"there will be no difference left between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad. Should it be so?\" Meanwhile, Kumar's key aide and national general secretary of JD Ashok Choudhary asserted that Nishant's entry into politics was \"not a political question\". The minister told reporters, \"It is not a political question on which we ought to speak. It is a decision the father-son duo has to take. Once they take the decision, it will not take even a day to complete formalities.\" This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.",

  "articleBody": "Amid the ongoing row over Aurangzeb's tomb in Maharashtra's Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said that while his government is obligated to protect the tomb as it is a protected site, it will not allow attempts to glorify the Mughal emperor's legacy.His remarks come in the backdrop of Hindutva organisations and party leaders calling for the demolition of Aurangzeb's tomb which they described as \"symbol of pain and slavery\".\"It is unfortunate that the government has to take responsibility for the protection of Aurangzeb's grave, despite his history of persecution. However, I assure you, if any attempt is made to glorify his legacy through 'mahima mandan', it will not succeed,\" the CM said.ALSO READ | High security at Aurangzeb tomb in Sambhajinagar after Hindu outfit's ‘Babri-like fate’ threatFadnavis was addressing a gathering after inaugurating a temple dedicated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Thane on his birth anniversary.He said that only the Maratha warrior's temple deserves glorification and not Aurangzeb's tomb.Meanwhile, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Monday protested outside various government offices during the day and submitted memorandums for the removal of Aurangzeb's grave in Khuldabad.Earlier, state minister Nitesh Rana also urged Hindutva bodies to carry out their responsibilities and leave the rest to the government.\"The government will do its part while Hindutva outfits must do theirs. When Babri Masjid was being demolished, we did not sit and talk to each other. Our karsevaks did what was appropriate,\" Rane said.However, Rane backed the calls made by Hindutva outfits regarding Aurangzeb's tomb.Security beefed up at Aurangzeb's tombSecurity arrangements were also beefed up at Aurangzeb's tomb, with the police administration making it mandatory for visitors to provide their identity cards before entering the site.The rural police department of the district implemented several security posts from the entry point to the Khuldabad town to the grave site.ALSO READ | Significant dip in footfall at Aurangzeb’s tomb amid controversyAn official, as cited by news agency PTI, also said that a State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) company of 50 policemen, 30 personnel from local police and 20 Home Guards have been deployed at various points and the tomb site.Tourists visiting the grave site are now required to write their names in a visitors register kept with a team of Home Guards and have to furnish identity proofs, he added.\"The situation here is peaceful, and people should not believe in rumours. Footfall of visitors has gone down after the demands to demolish the grave have come up. The footfall is usually low during Ramzan. Nearly 100 people visit daily, but the number has gone down since the issue was raised,\" said Parvez Kabeer Ahmed, the caretaker of Aurangzeb's grave.(With PTI inputs)",

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, The Indian Sign Language should be recognised as an official language by the government here to enure the dropout rate among deaf and hard-of-hearing students can be reduced, a study by University of Cambridge has recommended. The study noted that around one in five of India's deaf and hard-of-hearing children were out-of-school in 2014. \"Many thousands of children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing are missing out on school in India. This has a huge impact on their wellbeing and life chances,\" said Abhimanyu Sharma from Cambridge's Faculty of Modern &amp; Medieval Languages &amp; Linguistics, the study's author. \"One of the main reasons for this very high dropout rate is that their schools do not offer education in sign language.\" The study noted that sign language continues to be \"shunned\" in most Indian schools because it is still stigmatised as a visible marker of deafness. \"But the alternative preferred by many schools, 'oralism' harms the school attainment of deaf students. Outside of India, 'oralism' is widely criticised but the majority of schools in India continue to use it. Gesturing is not sign language, sign language is a language in its own right and these children need it,\" Sharma said. Oralism is the system of teaching deaf and hard-of-hearing people to communicate by the use of speech and lip-reading rather than sign language. \"When I was in primary school in Patna, one of my fellow students was deaf. Sign language was not taught in our school and it was very difficult for him,\" Sharma added. The study acknowledges the government has taken significant steps to make education more inclusive. He welcomed measures such as the establishment of the Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre in 2015. Sharma said, \"But far more work is needed to ensure that DHH students receive the education which they need and to which they are legally entitled.\" He has called for constitutional recognition for Indian Sign Language as well as recognition of ISL users as a linguistic minority. \"Being added to India's de facto list of official languages would direct more Government financial support to Indian Sign Language. Central and state governments need to open more schools and higher education institutes for deaf and hard-of-hearing students,\" Sharma also argued. \"In the whole of India, there are only 387 schools for deaf and hard-of-hearing children. The government urgently needs to open many more specialist schools to support the actual number of deaf and hard-of-hearing children, which has been underestimated,\" he added. The study pointed out that deaf and hard-of-hearing people were undercounted in India's last census because of the use of problematic terminology. The 2011 census reported around 5 million deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the country but in 2016, the National Association of the Deaf estimated that the true figure was closer to 18 million people. The study also highlights the need for more higher education institutions for these students as there are very few special colleges for them, such as the St Louis Institute for Deaf and Blind . \"There is need for an increase in the number of interpreter training programmes available across Indian universities. Central and state governments should conduct regular impact assessments of new policy measures to ensure that they are improving inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing people,\" Sharma said. The government should invest in research to support more targeted approaches to teaching and learning for DHH students and to support public awareness campaigns to tackle biases and negative social attitudes towards deafness, he said. Noting that India's language policy requires pupils to learn three languages at the secondary stage of schooling, he said that given the problematic nature of the three-language formula for deaf students, the 1995 Persons with Disabilities Act rescinds this requirement for these learners and decrees that they should learn only one language. \"The drawback of the 1995 Act, however, is that it does not mention the use of sign language and does not specify how language learning for such learners will be realised,\" he said. \"The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 brought significant improvements but highlights the gap between decrees and implementation. The 2016 Act decrees that the Government and local authorities shall take measures to train and employ teachers who are qualified in sign language and to promote the use of sign language. In practice, India does not have enough teachers trained to support deaf and hard-of-hearing students, but I am positive that the country can achieve this,\" he said.

  "articleBody": "Melbourne: Australia won the Centenary Test against England here today by 45 runs after the game swung back and forth on a gripping last day. The winning margin and result was exactly the same as in the first Test between the two countries in 1877. England’s brave bid to win the match faltered after tea when they lost five wickets for 41 runs to be all out for 417. The Test ended when England wicket-keeper Alan Knott was trapped leg-before by fast bowler Dennis Lillee in the second of the last 15 overs of the match. The Australian players rushed up and chaired Lillee from the field for his magnificent bowling throughout the match. Lillee, who announced today that he was retiring from Test cricket for at least a season because of a recurrence of a back injury, took 5 for 139 off 34.4 over to add to the 6 for 26 that he took in the first innings. However, England batsman Derek Randall won the “man of the match” award for his magnificent 174 which so nearly won the game for England. Randall was out 10 minutes before tea when England looked to be heading for a historic victory. England started today at 191 for two needing a total of 463 runs to win and it was not until after tea that Australia finally got back into the match. Randell who was not out 87 overnight, and Dennis Amiss batted throughout the morning session seeing off the second new ball and laying the basis for a victory charge by England in the last two sessions. The pair was parted ten minutes after lunch. When Amiss was out for 64 after a valuable 188-run third-wicket partnership. Keith Fletcher joined Randall but he lasted only about half an hour before Lillee disposed him of to make England 290 for 4. Then Randall, who had dominated the six Australian bowlers used in efforts to dismiss him, found the ideal partner in Tony Greig. They hit the Australian bowling to all parts of the field and an England win seemed certain as the score moved along at better than the rate required. However, ten minutes after Queen Elizabeth arrived at the Melbourne ground to watch the Test, disaster struck when Randall was caught at short-leg off leg-spinner Kerry O’Keeffe. With the departure of Randall, England were 346 for 5 and still seemed to have a chance. However. In the last session, the wickets tumbled as Lillee bowled at his fastest to clean up the England innings. Knott was the only batsman to offer any resistance in this final session as he saw Old out for two, Lever out for four, and Underwood out for 7. However, the England wicketkeeper’s lone bid was not enough and he was out for 42. It was a brave fight by England whose, total of 417 is the highest score by an. England side in the fourth innings of a Test against Australia. ",

  "articleBody": " Mumbai, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Monday said the Mahayuti government has prioritised infrastructure development along with agriculture, industries, employment generation and welfare schemes to achieve the goal of \"Viksit Maharashtra''. Replying to a debate in the legislative assembly on the state budget 2025-26, Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, said a political will is needed to dream big and achieve bigger development goals. The Mahayuti government has the strength and political will, he said. He said that if the road infrastructure and network are expanded, the productivity of industries grows, farmers bear less expenditure on transportation, fuel is saved, and the economy gets a boost. Pawar said the artificial intelligence technology will give a fresh lease of life to agriculture in the state and make farmers prosperous. He further assured that the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin scheme would continue and the money transferred to ineligible beneficiaries would not be taken back. Pawar said several women have used ₹1,500 as seed capital to start small businesses in the last few months, and many women have given up the Ujjwala LPG scheme benefits after an appeal that it is meant for poor sections of society. ''If such women are empowered, the state economy will benefit,'' he said. Pawar said some schemes are introduced as per prevailing circumstances, they are reviewed from time to time, and the outdated ones are scrapped. He said some schemes were stopped after the COVID-19 pandemic, and some programmes were scrapped to avoid duplication as the Central government announced similar ones. The minister said due to the government's focus on the development of agriculture, the growth rate of the sector rose to 8.7 per cent in 2024-25 compared to 3.3 per cent in 2023-24. He said the AI technology will provide crop management guidance and increase productivity. To achieve developmental goals, Pawar said the government has two options — increase revenue and take low-interest loans for development works. The government doesn't want to burden citizens with taxes, he said, adding that there is a Central government rule on the quantum of loan, and Maharashtra has followed rules. Maharashtra has always used the loans taken for capital expenditure and increasing investments, and there is an increase in revenue, he said. According to the RBI's risk analysis report, Maharashtra follows healthy fiscal indicators, Pawar said. He said in 2024-25, the state's estimated debt is ₹7.82 lakh crore, while in 2025-26, the state gross domestic product is estimated to be ₹49.39 lakh crore, and the debt is likely to be ₹9.32 lakh crore, which is 18.87 per cent of the GDP.

  "articleBody": "Earthquakes of magnitudes 3.0 to 4.9 increased between 2020 and 2024 in comparison with 2015 to 2019, minister of state for earth sciences Jitendra Singh informed the Lok Sabha.On March 12, responding to a question by TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee on whether earthquakes in India had risen during the period 2020-2024 in comparison to 2015-19, Singh said, “Earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 to 4.9 have increased from 2020 to 2024 compared to 2015-2019, indicating stress release and not allowing an accumulation of strain energy sufficiently for more number of earthquakes with magnitude beyond 5.0 and above, which are more or less similar in that during different durations.”Banerjee also asked for details of earthquakes reported during the last ten years and whether it was due to changes in seismic zones activities reported during 2010.The data provided by MoES shows earthquakes of M 3.0 to 3.9 increased from 1,224 in 2015-19 to 3,205 now. Earthquakes of M 3.9 to 4.9 increased from 1,663 from 2010-2014 to 2,203 between 2015 and 2019, and 2,408 between 2020 and 2024.There is no change in seismic zones due to increased seismicity. As per the Bureau of Indian Standards, the seismic hazard zonation map of the country is grouped into four seismic zones: II, III, IV and V, Singh said. “Of these, Zone V is seismically the most prone region, while zone II is the least based on the distribution of peak ground acceleration,” he said.“This classification helps us improve understanding of seismic risks and better prepare for potential earthquake-related hazards. This zoning system helps in providing more specific recommendations for building construction and land use planning in different regions, especially in areas prone to seismic activities,” he added.Singh said the national seismic network was enhanced with the installation of more seismic stations and observatories. This enabled better detection and real-time reporting of seismic events across the country. Further, the government issued new building codes and construction guidelines based on detailed investigations under seismic microzonation of cities in India that focused on making structures more earthquake risk resistant to seismic activities, particularly in high-risk zones (IV and V) to moderate risk zones (II and III).",

  "articleBody": " Idukki , Forest officials on Monday shot dead a tiger in self-defence as it attacked them during a tranquilising mission in Vandiperiyar in this hill district of Kerala. The injured big cat, which strayed from nearby forests, triggered panic among locals as it killed some domestic animals in Granby estate area in the recent days. Though the wildlife officials fired tranquiliser shots when it was spotted inside a tea estate in the morning, the tiger suddenly charged at them forcing the team to open fire for self defence. A senior wildlife official later said the second tranquiliser shot was successfully fired but the animal suddenly turned aggresive and destroyed the helmet of a wildlife staff by hitting at it. The tiger also tore the shield of one of the team members when it jumped towards them suddenly after getting the tranquiliser shot, he said. \"Our objective was to tranquilise the tiger and catch it alive. We went for the mission risking our own lives as it was spotted just near a house in the area in the morning. It killed a dog, two-three puppies and a cow calf,\" he told the media. \"We fired the tranquiliser shot standing just 15 meters away from the animal. We took that risk as the tiger was found in an inhabited area. We had no option other than to shoot it to protect ourselves,\" he added. The dead tiger was over 10 years old and looked very week with injuries in one of its legs, department sources added. In the visuals telecast by television channels on Monday morning, it could be seen that wildlife personnel firing tranquiliser shots at the tiger and the animal jumping towards them. Though a special team of wildlife personnel was all set to tranquilise the tiger on Sunday, the animal could not be traced. Authorities even used the service of sniffer dogs and drones to trace the animal. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.",

  "articleBody": "New Delhi: Ireland backs efforts by India and the European Union (EU) to finalise a free trade agreement (FTA) within the year as a deal will make trade “more friction-less” though such pacts are not simple, Irish higher education and innovation minister James Lawless said on Monday. Lawless, who is visiting India with a business delegation as part of Ireland’s practice of sending senior ministers to key capitals on the occasion of St Patrick’s Day, also highlighted opportunities in Ireland for Indian skilled workers such as healthcare personnel, fintech professionals and STEM graduates. Noting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently set their negotiators the target of finalising an FTA by the end of the year, Lawless said Ireland wants a deal since it will make trade “more friction-less and more seamless” and bolster two-way trade, currently worth 16 billion euros. “But I’m going to be honest and say that a new FTA is not simple. I’m not involved directly in that conversation, it’s something that the EU Commission is doing, but I would just say from my own experience that it is never as straightforward as it seems,” he said. “I know they have set a goal of end of the year. I wish them well...I would say that I would strongly support the FTA [because] we are a big fan of free trade. We think that countries do best when they can work with each other and trade with each other, talk to each other without barriers,” Lawless said against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s threat to hit trade partners with reciprocal tariffs from April 2. Lawless pointed to the scope for expanding trade in IT services with India, which is already one of the main pillars of two-way trade. In this context, he referred to geospatial technology, cloud computing, authentication of online IDs, and data handling and storage. “Indian companies and engineers are leading the way in these growth services space, as also business process management. I think we will continue to be consumers of those services in Ireland, we will need high quality products,” he said. With Ireland already home to some 100,000 Indians and 9,000 Indian students, the single largest group of foreign students, Lawless highlighted opportunities for Indian skilled workers. “STEM graduates are always in high demand in Ireland, right across mathematics, science, engineering and technology, because we focus on technology and standard engineering,” he said. “We have an ongoing need for healthcare professionals – nurses, physios, occupational therapists, speech therapists - and there’s already a strong tradition of Indian workers in those jobs,” he said, adding that Ireland also needs professionals for the financial services industry, new technologies such as blockchain and big data, and regulatory technology.

  "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Union environment ministry and two institutes at Harvard University will organise a four-day conference starting March 19 titled: ‘India 2047: Building a Climate-Resilient Future.’ Insights from the conference will contribute to shaping India’s upcoming National Adaptation Plan, the ministry said in a statement on Monday. The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute and the Salata Institute For Climate and Sustainability at the Harvard University, USA are the organising partners for the event. “This event will serve to identify the key challenges in adaptation and fine tune India’s response in terms of policies, programmes and action at the field level geared towards a climate-resilient India@2047,” the statement added. Suman Bery, vice chairperson, NITI Aayog and environment minister for state, Kirti Vardhan Singh will attend the conference. The event would also be addressed by speakers from the Centre, academia, research institutions, private sector and the Harvard University. Notable amongst them are Prof Tarun Khanna, director, The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute; Jorge Paulo Lemann, professor at the Harvard Business School; Prof Jim Stock, vice provost for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard University, Prof Daniel P. Schrag, professor of Environmental Science and Engineering at Harvard University, amongst others. The conference will have multiple breakout sessions with several technical sessions focusing on adaptation and resilience under the following themes: (i) climate science and its implications on water and agriculture, (ii) health, (iii) work, and (iv) built environment. The theme on climate science and its implications on agriculture and water will explore the scientific, policy, and practical dimensions of adapting to heatwaves, changing monsoon patterns, and water distribution issues. The theme on health convenes leading health professionals and health system experts, from India and the world to address essential questions on the impact of heat. The theme on work will focus on impact of climate change on labour productivity and the theme on built environment seeks to examine how built environment should be prepared for rising temperatures over the coming decades. There will be several crosscutting issues across these themes, such as governance, traditional knowledge, livelihood and skilling, gender, and financing. The workshops aim to generate tangible outputs such as research papers, technical documents, and policy briefs, as agreed upon by participants to contribute scientific evidence to global initiatives. This event will be a special opportunity to discuss adaptation and resilience to climate change amongst a receptive and influential audience in a location where this issue is an immediate concern,” the statement said. HT had reported on January 31 that India will prioritise climate adaptation efforts to safeguard its rapid economic expansion, even as decreasing global financial commitments for climate action may force developing nations to rework their targets, according to the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament. The survey highlighted that India’s adaptation expenditure rose to 5.6% of GDP in FY22 from 3.7% in FY16, underscoring the growing focus on building resilience against climate impacts as the country pursues its goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047. “In India’s case, most capacity additions to coal-fired power plants were made only in the 2010s. There is no valid economic rationale for shutting down coal plants, leaving huge investments underutilised and stranded and without a dependable alternative in place,” the survey had stated. The document criticised developed nations’ recent actions that prioritised energy security over climate goals. ",

  "articleBody": "The rise of emerging and re-emerging health threats in recent times underscores the critical necessity of strengthened preparedness, enhanced surveillance, and well-coordinated international response mechanisms to safeguard global health security, said Union minister of state for health, Anupriya Patel, during the launch of three-day Quad workshop on ‘Pandemic Preparedness for Indo-Pacific Region’ in Delhi on Monday.She added that India’s digital disease surveillance system offers a valuable model for other countries seeking to strengthen their public health infrastructure.The purpose of the three-day workshop, jointly organised by the ministries of health and external affairs, is to strengthen global health emergency frameworks, enhance preparedness and resilience to health threats, ensure coordinated responses to evolving pandemics, implementation of One Health approach, and address human, animal and environmental health through a multisectoral lens.Highlighting India’s commitment to strengthening global pandemic preparedness and response efforts, Patel said, “India has contributed USD 10 million towards the establishment of Pandemic Fund which was specially conceptualised for fighting pandemics.” “India has further pledged an additional USD 12 million to support its sustained functioning”, she said.Also Read: Govt steps led to dip in maternal, infant mortality rates: MoS in ParliamentThe junior health minister also said India has led digital health initiatives, leveraging technology to improve health access and outcomes, and create sustainable and data-driven systems.These efforts are central to building a health system capable of addressing both current as well as future health and climate challenges, she said.The minister said India has established a comprehensive health emergency coordination framework, strategically focused on preparedness, response and resilience-building through setting up several key initiatives within the healthcare system towards the vision of creating and stabilising a resilient and pandemic-ready healthcare system.“India has led digital health initiatives, leveraging technology to improve health access, outcomes, and create sustainable, data-driven systems. India, as a lighthouse country in digital health technologies, has been at the forefront of deliberations across various international forums,” said Patel.She cited India’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP), National One Health Programme for Prevention and Control of Zoonosis and National Vector Borne Disease Control and Prevention among others.India’s harnessing of digital technology in healthcare through initiatives such as Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) and tools such as the CoWIN platform, eSanjeevani, National Telemedicine Service, Tele-MANAS to manage mental health diseases, and the Ni-Kshay portal for tracking monitoring and management of tuberculosis patients, she said.“India is keen to share our Digital Public Infrastructures (DPIs) with the global community, especially with our friends in the Global South to enable modern healthcare approaches. We are also willing to offer courses and capacity-building training in partnership with our MEA in identified areas of interest in the health sector,” she added.Ajay Kumar Sood, principal scientific advisor to the government of India, highlighted the efforts being taken to integrate health services in India. “There is a need for sharing of technologies for better surveillance, disease modelling and improve public health systems for better preparedness. This workshop presents a unique approach to address health challenges collaboratively with like-minded partner countries,” he said.Sood also highlighted the need for more engagement among students and scientific community for fostering innovation.India is hosting the Quad Workshop on Pandemic Preparedness for the Indo-Pacific Region between March 17-19, as an outcome of the 6th Quad Leaders’ Summit held in September 2024, during which the Quad leaders committed to enhancing collaboration in health security and pandemic preparedness.",

I may seem happy, but I am scared, we just want her to be back on earth and in sound health.\"His remarks came in the backdrop of concerns over Williams and her colleague Barry 'Butch' Wilmore's chances of facing significant bodily changes upon their return to Earth after such a long journey.ALSO READ | Sunita Williams may face painful return to Earth: Bone density loss, baby feet, and moreThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Sunday confirmed that Williams and Wilmore will return on Tuesday, March 18, evening (GMT).The two astronauts are flying back home along with a Russian cosmonaut aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which arrived at the ISS early Sunday.The NASA astronauts duo has been on the space station since June last year after travelling up to space on the Boeing Starliner aircraft, which was hit by multiple issues, including helium leak and propulsion problems.The spacecraft, which went on its maiden crewed journey, was then deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.ALSO READ | NASA confirms Sunita Williams' Earth return date, shares splashdown timeWilliam's cousin Rawal, while expressing concern for the NASA astronaut, also recalled memories from their childhood. \"When she was small, she came here, I used to take her for camel rides, she would not get off the camel. We did pilgrimage to Somnath, we also went on trips to various places in India. I attended her marriage in Boston.\"\"She has been courageous since she was small.

  "articleBody": "Ahead of their protest against the alleged ₹1,000 crore-worth irregularities at the TASMAC headquarters, BJP Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai and several other party leaders were detained by the police in Chennai on Monday.BJP's women's wing national chief Vanathi Srinivasan and senior state leader H Raja were also among those detained.The BJP had earlier announced a state-wide protest against the TASMAC headquarters in Chennai over the alleged irregularities worth ₹1,000 crore, as earlier claimed by the Enforcement Directorate.Following their detention, Annamalai slammed the \"autocratic\" Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government, saying it thinks that by using the state police department, it has prevented the BJP's protest against the \"liquor scam\" by arresting party leaders, functionaries and cadres.ALSO READ | ‘Unaccounted’ cash deals worth ₹1,000 cr in TASMAC, says ED\"People of Tamil Nadu know that the accused number 1 in the TASMAC Liquor scam is TN CM Thiru (MK Stalin) @mkstalin,\" he wrote in a post on X, adding, \"We will continue to protest against this corrupt, tyrannical DMK govt.\"He asked, \"How long will you keep arresting us?\" Annamalai alleged the ruling DMK government and CM MK Stalin's \"rupee symbol and budget drama\" were an attempt to divert attention from the recent ED raids at the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC), besides other entities.Further, the Tamil Nadu BJP chief also alleged that senior party leaders including former state president Tamilisai Soundararajan were \"placed under house arrest\" by the police.Senior BJP leaders including H Raja, Pon Radhakrishnan, BJP Mahila Morcha chief and Coimbatore South MLA Vanathi Srinivasan, the party's legislators Dr C Saraswathi, MR Gandhi, Nainar Nagenthran and functionaries including Vinoj P Selvam and Amar Prasad Reddy were detained.ALSO READ | BJP's Tamilisai Soundararajan detained in Chennai for protest against TASMAC ‘scam’He accused Stalin of being afraid that something would be found and thus was 'strangulating' the BJP's voice.Annamalai also told reporters that although the ED has quantified the alleged irregularities in TASMAC at ₹1,000 crore, he estimates it to be ₹40,000 crore.\"This ₹1000 crore is the tip of the iceberg...this protest will not only shake up TN politics but will pave the way for ushering in good politics. My guess is this (scam) will be worth ₹40,000 crore. But I am in a responsible position, so I am quoting the ₹1,000 crore mentioned by the ED,\" he added.The state BJP chief even said that once the anti-corruption agency submits its final report, CM Stalin might also be on the radar.What did the ED say?Earlier, the Enforcement Directorate said it found \"multiple irregularities\" in the TASMAC operations, including \"manipulation\" in the tender processes and \"unaccounted\" cash transactions worth ₹1,000 crore through distillery companies, a news agency PTI report said.According to the federal probe agency, it got 'evidence' after it raided the employees, corporate offices of the distilleries and plants of TASMAC on March 6. It claimed that there were 'kickbacks' involved.Support to BJP's protestMeanwhile, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) founder and Lok Sabha MP, Thol Thirumavalavan, who is also a staunch critic of the BJP, extended his support to the saffron camp's agitation.However, the DMK ally said his party's stand was that there should be no liquor in the state, adding that all the shops should be closed down.\"Maybe the police action (against BJP leaders) was from the law and order point of view. We welcome the protest...our stand is that liquor shops in Tamil Nadu should be closed down and we will welcome anyone who supports that,\" he told reporters.Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) president Dr Anbumani Ramadoss, on the other hand, criticised the police action against the BJP leaders. He wondered as to why BJP leaders were held even before a protest could be staged.(with PTI inputs)",

  "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: India and the US on Monday explored avenues for deepening collaboration in areas including cutting-edge defence innovation and niche technologies, with both sides expressing their shared commitment to advancing mutual strategic interests during talks between defence minister Rajnath Singh and US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.“They addressed key areas such as enhancing interoperability and fostering greater integration of defence industrial supply chains to bolster resilience and innovation,” the defence ministry said.The talks came at a time when the two sides are looking at expanding defence cooperation with focus on multiple domains in land, air, maritime and space, interoperability, logistics and information sharing, and joint military exercises.“Happy to have met the US Director of National Intelligence Ms @TulsiGabbard in New Delhi. We discussed a wide range of issues which include defence and information sharing, aiming to further deepen the India-US partnership,” Singh said in a post on X.On Sunday, she participated in a meeting of top security officials from around the world. Here to attend the Raisina Dialogue, Gabbard is the first senior official of the Trump administration to travel to India. Drawing from the joint statement issued after the recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump, the discussions reaffirmed the growing strength of the India-US bilateral defence partnership, the ministry said in a statement.“Both leaders emphasised that strategic security remains a vital pillar of the comprehensive global strategic cooperation between the two nations. They reviewed the significant strides made in the areas of military exercises, strategic cooperation, integration of defence industrial supply chains and information-sharing cooperation, especially in the maritime domain,” the statement added.In February, Singh and his US counterpart Pete Hegseth reviewed the ongoing defence cooperation and explored ways and means to expand and deepen the India-US bilateral defence relationship.Both sides have made progress under the US-India Defence Industrial Cooperation Roadmap, including ongoing collaboration to advance priority co-production arrangements for jet engines, munitions, and ground mobility systems.The roadmap, adopted in 2023, seeks to fast-track technology cooperation and co-production in critical areas including air combat and land mobility systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, munitions, and the undersea domain.Last October, India signed a deal worth $3.5 billion with the US to acquire 31 MQ-9B drones to boost its defence preparedness, primarily with an eye on China. The agreement came after a deliberative process in New Delhi that spanned eight years, involved negotiations with two US administrations, incorporated the lease of two drones in this period, and required, at the American end, a challenging process of congressional approval.Fifteen drones are meant for the navy, and eight each for the army and the air force.Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is also negotiating a deal with US firm GE Aerospace for the joint production of F414 engines in India. The two firms signed a memorandum of understanding in Washington in June 2023 to produce 99 F414 engines for India’s future LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-2 programme.The joint production of the engines will help the country overcome a striking technology gap, lay the foundation for indigenous development of bigger jet engines and possibly open doors to exports.Singh’s meeting with Gabbard came a month after Trump revealed that America is paving the way to provide India the F-35 stealth fighters and the two countries announced plans for the co-production of US-made Javelin anti-tank guided missiles and Stryker infantry combat vehicles in India during Modi’s visit to the US.To be sure, on March 8, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, said India had not looked at the F-35 option, and no offer had been made by the US, pointing out that buying a fighter plane was not the same as “buying a washing machine or refrigerator.”",

  "articleBody": "Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy on Monday said his government is facing a cash crunch due to the debt burden and other factors, and that it has been able to pay salaries to employees after obtaining a “hand loan” of ₹4,000 crore from the Reserve Bank of India.Replying to a question in the state legislative council, Revanth Reddy said his government was struggling to pay salaries to its employees on the first day of every month regularly. “Like people in the villages take hand loans to meet their emergency needs, we are forced to approach the Reserve Bank of India every month to take ₹4,000 crore towards ways and means advances to pay salaries to the employees on time,” he said.The chief minister urged the employees to understand the situation and assured them of complete transparency regarding the state’s financial position. “This is your government. We shall place all accounts before the employees. You decide how much to spend on what and what payments we can withhold,” he said.Stating that the government employees were fully legitimate in their demand for asking dearness allowance, Revanth Reddy said his government is in a helpless situation even to pay salaries to the employees on the first day of every month.“I request the employees not to insist on the DA arrears for now in view of the present difficult financial situation. When we become sick, we control our food intake and follow strict diet norms. Similarly, when the state financial position is sick, the employees should defer their demands for some time,” he said, adding even if the government wants to sell assets to pay DA arrears, it won’t be sufficient.Bharat Rashtra Samithi working president and former minister KT Rama Rao hit out at Revanth Reddy. “The chief minister himself has admitted that the revenue to the state have come down in the last one year. It is a big humiliation to the state government,” KTR said.",

  "articleBody": "Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday voiced his support for learning Hindi, calling on states to avoid doing \"unnecessary politics\" over languages.Naidu's remarks gain significance against the backdrop of the ongoing language row in Tamil Nadu and other southern states over the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and its three-language policy.He described Hindi as the 'national language' and said that learning it would only help in fluent communication in Delhi.“I am telling this very clearly to you, language is not for hating. Here (in Andhra Pradesh) the mother tongue is Telugu. Hindi is the national language and the international language is English,” Naidu told the state assembly.He further said, \"That’s why you should all remember, refraining from engaging in unnecessary politics, today, let’s all think, language is useful for communication, hence, it is good to learn as many languages as possible.\"The key NDA ally also advocated learning multiple languages to better employment opportunities while also maintaining the root connection to one's mother tongue.ALSO READ | 'Never opposed Hindi': Pawan Kalyan amid row over 'Tamil movie dubbing' remarkThe Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief also claimed that only those who study in their mother tongue are succeeding across the world, adding that a misconception is going around that only the English language can guarantee knowledge.\"Language is only for communication. Knowledge will not come with language. Only people who study in their mother tongue are excelling across the world. It is easy to learn (through the mother tongue),\" said Naidu.Citing that many people are going to countries like Japan and Germany, learning the languages of those countries here in India could only help people when they visit these overseas destinations.Later, in an official press release as well, Naidu defended the three-language policy and said that language is a tool for communication but not a barrier.Earlier, Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister and Jana Sena Party supremo Pawan Kalyan had stirred controversy with his 'Tamil movie dubbing' remark, following which, he issued a clarification on his stance on Hindi language.Kalyan had asserted that he never opposed Hindi as a language but only stood against its compulsory imposition.\"Either imposing a language forcibly or opposing a language blindly; both don't help to achieve the objective of National & Cultural integration of our Bharat. I had never opposed Hindi as a language. I only opposed making it compulsory. When the NEP 2020 itself does not enforce Hindi, spreading false narratives about its imposition is nothing but an attempt to mislead the public,\" Naidu's deputy had said.(with PTI inputs)",

  "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: A total of 126 women cadets have joined the National Defence Academy (NDA) after the government opened the doors of the premier training academy at Khadakwasla for them three years ago, minister of state for defence Sanjay Seth told Rajya Sabha on Monday. Data furnished in the Upper House showed that only five of the women cadets resigned. At 35, Haryana accounts for the maximum number of women who joined NDA, followed by Uttar Pradesh (28) and Rajasthan (13). Adequate facilities are being provided to women cadets at NDA on a par with their male counterparts, and several measures are undertaken pan-India to encourage women to join the army, Seth said. In August 2021, the Supreme Court directed the government to allow women to take the next entrance exam for the NDA and the first batch was inducted the following year. The Apex court’s order making women eligible to join NDA came almost three decades after women were allowed to serve in select branches of the three services as short-service commission (SSC) officers, and 18 months after the top court ruled that women officers, who have joined the Indian Army through SSC, were entitled to permanent commission and command roles. Students become eligible to take the NDA and Naval Academy Examination, conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), while they are in the 12th standard. Those who clear the entrance exam must face the Services Selection Board (a rigourous personality and intelligence test spread over five days) and the candidates accepted by the SSB undergo a medical examination before the UPSC releases the final merit list. After training at the NDA for three years, split into six terms, cadets head for further training at different academies depending on their choice of service before getting commissioned as officers.

  "articleBody": "Abraham ThomasThe Supreme Court on Monday directed the Rajasthan government to demolish encroachments on a wetland forming part of a park near Anasagar lake in Ajmer within six months and observed that destruction of wetlands is invitation to disaster.A bench headed by justice Abhay S Oka held that any encroachment on a wetland must go and shot down the argument by Rajasthan to save the illegal construction as demolishing it would result in a great loss to the public exchequer.The top court said, “If states are allowed to destroy wetlands, we are inviting disaster. The intention of the government should be to restore wherever there is a wetland. Under any cost, wetlands have to be protected.”The court was hearing an appeal filed by Rajasthan government that was asked to restore the Anasagar Lake in Ajmer as a wetland by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in December 2021 with a further direction in August 2023 to demolish any encroachment or construction in the ‘buffer area’ of the lake.The state had objected to the NGT order by claiming that the site in question is not a declared wetland. Close to the lake, the state had planned recreational facilities including a “Seven Wonders Park” having replicas of the seven monuments from around the globe, a food court, pathways and markets in the vicinity. The development was made with a view to develop Ajmer as a smart city.On Monday, the state chief secretary appeared online during the proceeding and even filed affidavit undertaking to remove the food court and the replicas in the Seven Wonders Park within six months.The bench directed the state to remove the structures insides the park and clear the food court within the stipulated period of six months.As an auditorium too had been constructed, which the state was keen to retain, the bench said, “Before considering other parts of the affidavit, if state wants to maintain the work done on wetlands, it should come out with a proposal to recreate wetland double the space in the state.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta appearing for the state sought time to take instructions in this regard. For considering the state’s proposal, the matter was posted for hearing on April 7.The bench, also comprising justice Ujjal Bhuyan, said, “On first principle, the state should never have constructed on wetland. In this way you can never be a smart city. If you (state) want some part of the encroachment to be saved, you propose to create double the wetland space in the state.”Mehta proposed converting the concrete pathways into a green landscape as demolishing everything will cast a huge burden on the exchequer. Responding to this argument, the bench said, \"We will not hear the argument from the state that wetlands are being encroached and to remove it now involves a huge cost to the exchequer,” the bench said.The court did not wish to be party to the state’s plan to of its construction abutting wetland. “If anything is constructed on wetland it has to go. We thought the state will come out with a pragmatic stand,” it remarked.The court said that the only order it was open to consider was to grant time for relocating or removing the encroachment. Mehta pointed out that a wall and a sidewalk constructed near the lake was meant to protect the waterbody from encroachment. But the court reasoned with the state that even the wall was constructed on the wetland and must go.The bench cited the International Ramsar Convention to which India became party in February 1982. Since then, 89 wetlands covering an area of over 15 lakh hectares have been designated under the List of Wetlands of International Importance.The NGT had in the past in December 2021 directed preservation of Anasagar lake – a man-made lake in existence since the 12th century. The order of the tribunal stated that the lake used to serve as a source of drinking water for Ajmer city, getting its water from a seasonal river called Luni, originating in the Aravalli range.It was on a petition filed by Ashok Malik, the NGT issued orders for demolishing construction around the lake. The tribunal had even directed an inspection team to visit the site following which it came to light that the lake was getting polluted due to the untreated wastewater from the nearby colonies and shops. This further impacted the biodiversity of the lake and posed health hazards for the local community.The petition before the tribunal said that with the construction of pathway along the lake boundary, various activities such as car workshops, marriage gardens, halls and restaurants had sprung up along the lake, despite the area being declared a ‘no-construction zone’ in 2014.While examining the issue last month, the top court had observed, “We wonder how a city can become smart without protecting the water bodies/wetlands in the city and how cities will become smarter by making encroachments on the water bodies/wetlands.”",

  "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs) built as part of the Smart Cities Mission may be integrated into unified e-governance platforms based on local circumstances and requirements, minister of state for housing and urban affairs Tokhan Sahu told the Rajya Sabha on Monday.India’s 100 cities covered under the mission have functional ICCCs.“To ensure long-term financial sustainability, several cities have introduced various revenue-generating mechanisms such as revenue sharing with traffic departments by generating automated e-challans, leasing Variable Messaging Displays (VMDs) for commercial advertisements and promotions etc,” Sahu said, responding to Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Manoj Kumar Jha who had asked the the ambit of ICCCs would be expanded.Sahu added that ICCCs were undergoing a standardisation, testing, and quality certification (STQC) audit to enhance data security and ensure protection against cyber threats and vulnerabilities.As the mission draws to a close on March 31, the states must maintain the operation of ICCCs.In February 2024, a parliamentary panel, in its report titled ‘Smart Cities Mission: An Evaluation’ highlighted the need for a comprehensive framework and operation and maintenance strategies for assets created under the mission to ensure increased lifetime utility, value of infrastructure/assets, and their timely upgradation.The committee also underlined that the digital infrastructure and assets created under SCM be maintained and privacy safeguards should be put in place.A recent study by IIM Bangalore said 93 cities across India have installed over 59,802 CCTV cameras and emergency call boxes with real-time monitoring systems through Integrated Command and Control Centers (ICCCs) under the SCM. “Currently, there is a gap between the number of cases which request ICCC for the camera footage and out of those only less than 50% of the requests are fulfilled,” they said. In the improved scenario, the authors suggested that ICCCs should target to provide footage for crimes in 75% of such cases.” ",

  "articleBody": "US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who is on an official visit to India, on Monday met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who presented her with Gangajal from the recently concluded Maha Kumbh Mela.PM Modi also presented Gabbard with a rudraksha bead mala.WATCHIn a post on X, PM Modi welcomed Gabbard to India and said that the two exchanged views on further strengthening comprehensive global strategic partnership between New Delhi and Washington.\"Both countries are committed to combating terrorism and enhancing maritime and cyber security cooperation,\" he added.The Prime Minister and Gabbard had met each other in the United States last month after the US intelligence chief was newly elected to her post. PM Modi said that the two had discussed India-US friendship and congratulated her for becoming US President Donald Trump's Director of National Intelligence.Gabbard is on a two-and-a-half-day trip to India in the first high-level visit to New Delhi by a top official of the Trump administration.In an interview with news agency ANI, Gabbard cited the meeting between PM Modi and President Trump and said that there is no limit to cooperation between India and the US.\"I think there's not any bounds to where the United States and India are looking to cooperate,\" she said.She noted that during the two leaders' meeting at the White House last month, they resolved to expand trade and investment to make their citizens more prosperous and nations stronger.Talking about the tariff threat to India, Gabbard also said that New Delhi and Washington are engaged in a direct dialogue at the very top.\"There is more potential for strengthening our economic relationship and I'm glad to see that they're looking at it in a more positive light than just one that is focused in a negative way when we look at tariffs. Obviously, Prime Minister Modi is looking out for what is in the best interest of India's economy and the opportunities available for the people of India. Similarly, President Trump is doing the same for the United States, our economic interests and the interests of the American people \" she added.The US intelligence chief said that both Trump and PM Modi are looking for a \"good solution\". She also noted that the friendship between the two leaders is the foundation on which India and the US will build their partnership.Gabbard meets Rajnath SinghEarlier in the day, Tulsi Gabbard had met with defence minister Rajnath Singh, who conveyed concerns over the activities of the Khalistani separatist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) on American soil and urged her to declare it a designated terrorist entity.In a meeting at Singh's office in the Raisina Hills, Singh also informed Gabbard about SFJ's alleged links with Pakistani spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as well as its alleged \"collaboration\" with Babbar Khalsa militant group, and pressed for action against it, news agency PTI reported citing sources.Singh raised concerns over SFJ targeting various Hindu religious structures in the US and said that such activities must be stopped.",

  "articleBody": "The Supreme Court on Monday emphasised that courts should not issue gag orders against media organisations and underlined that fair criticism of a judicial order cannot be construed as contempt of court, expressing concerns over a Delhi high court directive requiring Wikipedia to remove within 36 hours a page related to a pending ₹2 crore defamation suit filed by news agency Asian News International (ANI) against the platform.“Why should courts be touchy about some comments made against their orders in social media?” asked a bench comprising justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan, highlighting the importance of free speech rights for media organisations. The top court observed that it was “ironical” that ANI, itself a media entity, was seeking a gag order against another platform that disseminates information.The bench questioned the Delhi high court’s order issued on October 16, 2024, which held that criticism of a judicial order by the crowd-sourced encyclopedia Wikipedia amounted to “interference in court proceedings.”The bench made it clear that judicial criticism, even when directed at a court’s proceedings, does not automatically amount to contempt as it admitted an appeal filed by Wikimedia Foundation against the high court’s order.Also Read | Delhi HC directs Wikipedia to take down page on ANI suit against the platform“Sometimes, someone says that you are sitting here with a preconceived mind or that you are not giving a proper hearing. People say things, and we have to tolerate it,” observed the bench . It further questioned why courts should be overly sensitive to remarks made on social media and reaffirmed that passing gag orders against media organizations is not permissible.“Courts can’t pass gag orders. Someone may be proceeded against under a criminal contempt action, a notice will be issued, and the other side can opt to purge the contempt. But to tell someone to remove something just because there is some criticism of what the court has said or done is not okay,” remarked the bench.It also pointed out that judges themselves are frequently the subject of public scrutiny and critical remarks but that courts must adjudicate on legal principles rather than take offence. “So much is said about us even as we are judges. Someone says we are prejudiced. That’s their opinion, but we decide on law,” it added.Also Read | Why Delhi high court called Wikipedia editing function ‘dangerous’The Supreme Court’s intervention came after Wikipedia challenged the Delhi high court’s order, which directed the platform to take down a page discussing the defamation suit filed by ANI. ANI initiated legal proceedings against Wikipedia for alleged defamation. After ANI filed a contempt plea alleging that Wikipedia failed to comply with a prior disclosure order from August 20, the high court directed the platform to remove the page, calling it “prima facie contemptuous” and an interference with court proceedings.The controversy escalated when another Wikipedia page titled “Asian News International vs. Wikimedia Foundation” appeared. This new page claimed that the presiding single judge in the matter had threatened to order the closure of Wikipedia’s business transactions in India if the platform did not comply with court orders. The page further alleged that the single judge’s order directing Wikipedia to reveal details of users who edited ANI’s Wikipedia page amounted to censorship and posed a threat to the free flow of information.Taking a strong stance against Wikipedia’s handling of the case, the high court stated that the online encyclopedia could not be allowed to “threaten the judge” and reiterated that the sub judice principle had been violated. The court also questioned Wikipedia’s legal protections under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, which grants intermediary platforms immunity from liability for third-party content.Wikipedia, through its counsel, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, defended its position in the Supreme Court, arguing that the high court had issued an order without even making a determination on the alleged contempt or defamation.The Supreme Court took cognisance of these arguments and directed that the matter be examined further. “The question here is about free speech rights of media,” noted the bench, making it clear that courts must not curtail freedom of expression through overly broad or preemptive restrictions.While the ANI’s counsel contended that Wikipedia had not complied with previous orders of the high court and was thus in contempt, the bench retorted: “Look at the irony here. You are a media organisation and are pressing for a gag order against another media organisation.”In its order, the bench stated that it was specifically concerned about the legality and validity of that part of the Delhi high court’s order, which declared Wikipedia’s content to be contemptuous. It proceeded to issue a notice to ANI and listed the matter for hearing in the last week of March.",

  "articleBody": " Thane, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday inaugurated a temple dedicated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Thane district, and lauded the Maratha king for fighting for 'Swarajya' and the country. The Maratha king's birth anniversary was being celebrated across the state on Monday as per the 'tithi'. The state government's official 'Shiv Jayanti' celebrations are held on February 19 each year. Fadnavis said just as Lord Ram's darshan is incomplete without Hanuman, no pilgrimage is complete without paying respect to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. \"We are able to worship our gods freely today because of Shivaji Maharaj's efforts. He fought for Swarajya, for God, for our country, and our religion,\" he said. On the occasion, Fadnavis also addressed the ongoing discourse about historical monuments in Maharashtra, particularly the demand from some right-wing outfits for the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb at Khuldabad in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district. Fadnavis said while the government is obligated to protect Aurangzeb's tomb as a declared protected site, its preservation is a matter of historical record rather than reverence. He said only the temple of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj deserves \"mahima mandan\" and not the tomb of Aurangzeb. \"It is unfortunate that the government has to take responsibility for the protection of Aurangzeb's grave, despite his history of persecution. However, I assure you, if any attempt is made to glorify his legacy through 'mahima mandan', it will not succeed,\" the CM said. Fadnavis further said even though Shivaji died at an early age, his contribution to the society has helped the people follow his legacy. Maharashtra has lived up to the expectations and it is evident from the approach of the people the state, he said. The state's first temple dedicated to Shivaji Maharaj, constructed at Maradepada in Bhiwandi area of Thane, features architectural elements inspired by the Maratha forts and murals depicting the warrior king's reign and contributions. The temple has been built by the Shivkranti Pratishthan Trust under the leadership of Dr Raju Chowdhary. The temple's idol of Shivaji Maharaj has been created by noted sculptor Arun Yogiraj, who crafted Ram Lalla idol adoring the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The temple of Shivaji Maharaj spans across 2,500 square feet, with a surrounding masonry fence covering 5,000 sq ft. The project extends across four acres and features a unique design comprising 36 divisions in the masonry fence, each showcasing significant moments from the history of the Maratha empire. The temple is expected to attract tourists, historians and people who revere Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Fadnavis said the state government has submitted a proposal to UNESCO to recognise 12 forts of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as World Heritage Sites. Additionally, the government plans to take over and develop the palace in Sangameshwar, where Shivaji Maharaj's son Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was deceitfully captured. Fadnavis also said a request has been made to the Uttar Pradesh government to give possession of a cell in the Agra Fort, where Shivaji Maharaj was once imprisoned, to the Maharashtra government for the purpose of establishing a historical memorial. Dr Chowdhary said the Shivaji Maharaj's temple is not just a place of worship, but also a historical and educational hub which will help preserve and spread awareness about the great Maratha ruler's vision, governance and military achievements.

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, The government plans to add 120 new locations through the UDAN scheme in the next 10 years and aims to connect 4 crore people through it, Minister of Civil Aviation Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu informed the Rajya Sabha on Monday. Replying to supplementaries during Question Hour, the minister said the UDAN scheme is one of the most successful schemes in the country and many other countries have praised it. \"The thought process behind the scheme has been to connect all the airports together. It has been observed that many of the airports even after building, the viability was an issue for the airlines to start connectivity. It was at that point, the UDAN scheme was envisaged and the viability gap funding was given,\" the minister said. \"We have almost given 1.5 crore people of the county the benefits due to the UDAN scheme,\" the minister also told the house. In the recent budget speech, he said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman extended the UDAN scheme for another 10 years and we are extending it because of the success of the scheme. \"In the last 10 years we have connected 1.5 crore people and in the next 10 years, we want to connect 4 crore more people and bring in 120 new destinations,\" he said. Noting that we are talking about 120 new locations being connected to the UDAN scheme, Naidu said the way this UDAN scheme functions, we have taken the under-served and unserved airports which have less than seven air connectivity in a week.. He said there the government bids the routes and the airlines come in through a transparent bidding process. On complaints that UDAN routes are not continuing after some time, the minister said the UDAN routes are only there for three years. \"It is not that eternally we want to subsidise and give the viability gap funding to all these routes. It is to help kickstart that region, it is to kickstart that route and airport and start connectivity,\" he said. On the issue of decongestion of major airports, he said the bringing in of all these unutilised airports with less activity, once you make more connectivity to these obviously decongestion happens. \"Congestion happens when the connectivity flows to one airport, which is why we want to spread the connectivity to different airports. With the coming in of more airports, congestion happens,\" he said. On high airfares, the minister said we are following the international principle where the market drives the airfares. \"We are ensuring our best from the ministry, because we don't want airfares to be high,\" Naidu said. \"If we have more aircraft in the country, we from the ministry are trying to ensure more number of aircraft to come in. We want more airlines to come in and we are promoting the industry to ensure that price dynamics are ensured,\" he said. The minister also said that we have a tariff monitoring unit under the DGCA and it considers the previous year's data and if there is any exorbitant rise, we have a meeting with the airlines. He said even during the recent Maha Kumbh, the ministry held a meeting with the airlines whenever the airfares were exorbitant.

  "articleBody": " Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel on Monday called for strict enforcement of laws to prevent crimes against women, urging authorities to adopt a \"zero tolerance\" approach. She emphasised that law enforcement must remain vigilant and that public awareness campaigns should be conducted at the village level to curb issues like child marriage and drug abuse. \"We must make people aware and take initiatives at the grassroots level. If needed, we should conduct awareness marches in villages. Police officials must remain active and ensure crimes against women are stopped with a policy of zero tolerance,\" Patel said. The Governor praised district officials for adopting 40 villages, aiming to transform them into model villages through the effective implementation of government schemes, according to a statement issued by the Raj Bhavan in Lucknow. She cited Maharajganj's progress in uplifting Mushar and Vantangia communities, stating, \"It is commendable that officials have taken up the responsibility of these villages. The district administration must now ensure 100 per cent saturation of welfare schemes so that no one is left behind.\" Speaking at a gathering at the Collectorate Complex, Patel distributed benefits under various welfare schemes, including preschool education kits for Anganwadi centres, appointment letters for newly selected Anganwadi workers, Ayushman cards, and nutritional kits for tuberculosis patients. Highlighting the crucial role of Anganwadi centres, Patel remarked, \"Anganwadi workers are like Mother Yashoda for the children. They don't just teach but also take care of the children's health and nutrition. Their training in child psychology is essential for creating a nurturing learning environment.\" She also lauded the recruitment of 210 new, highly educated Anganwadi workers, expressing confidence that their qualifications would enhance early childhood education. Patel visited stalls set up by various government departments, including Women and Child Development, Rural Development, Agriculture, Panchayati Raj, Fisheries, and Livestock. Stressing the need for efficient implementation of welfare schemes, she stated, \"Every scheme must reach the last beneficiary. The impact of these programs depends on proper execution and continuous monitoring.\" This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.",

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the Madras High Court order directing a CBI probe into corruption allegations against former AIADMK minister K T Rajenthra Bhalaji in a cash-for-job scam case. A bench comprising Justices Pankaj Mithal and S V N Bhatti passed the order while hearing two pleas including the one filed by the Tamil Nadu government against the high court’s decision. The high court, on January 6, ordered a CBI investigation in the case after it found that the state government did not comply with its earlier direction asking it to file a chargesheet in this matter. The top court asked the Tamil Nadu government to provide the translated documents to the governor’s secretariat within two weeks and directed the governor’s office to take an expeditious decision on the pending sanction. In the meantime, the bench stayed the high court’s order and restrained the CBI from conducting further investigations. During the hearing, senior advocate Amit Anand Tiwari, appearing for the state government, asserted that the state police had submitted a chargesheet, contrary to the high court’s observation. The senior lawyer said that a sanction under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act had been sought, and the investigation was ongoing. Additionally, he pointed out that a sanction application under Section 19 of the Act is currently pending before the Tamil Nadu governor. The delay, he explained, was due to the governor’s request for English translations of relevant Tamil documents. On behalf of Rajenthra Bhalaji, senior advocate V Giri argued that the case did not merit a routine transfer to the CBI, citing a lack of cogent reasons for such a move. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, representing the complainant, alleged that the Tamil Nadu government was attempting to shield the former minister.

  "articleBody": "Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday flagged India’s concerns about the activities of US-based secessionist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), which has called for the creation of Khalistan, and its links with Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence, during talks with US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, people aware of the matter said.Singh and Gabbard also explored avenues for deepening collaboration in areas including cutting-edge defence innovation and niche technologies, with both sides expressing their shared commitment to advancing mutual strategic interests.“They addressed key areas such as enhancing interoperability and fostering greater integration of defence industrial supply chains to bolster resilience and innovation,” the defence ministry said.Also Read | Persecution, killing of Hindus in Bangladesh a concern for US: Tulsi GabbardSingh urged Gabbard to designate the SFJ, headed by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, as a terrorist entity and clamp down on its anti-India activities being carried out on Americal soil, the people cited in the first instance said, asking not to be named. Pannun has already been declared a terrorist by India and his organisation, SFJ, banned under an anti-terror law.Seeking strict action against the Khalistani outfit, the minister highlighted its linkages with other terror organisations, including Babbar Khalsa International, HT has learnt. SFJ is known for issuing threats to Indian political leaders, diplomats and other officials, besides targeting Hindu temples.The talks came at a time when the two sides are looking at expanding defence cooperation with focus on multiple domains in land, air, maritime and space, interoperability, logistics and information sharing, and joint military exercises.Also Read | PM Modi meets Tulsi Gabbard, gifts her gangajal from Maha Kumbh, Rudraksh mala“Happy to have met the US Director of National Intelligence Ms @TulsiGabbard in New Delhi. We discussed a wide range of issues which include defence and information sharing, aiming to further deepen the India-US partnership,” Singh wrote on X.On Sunday, Gabbard participated in a meeting of top security officials from around the world. Here to attend the Raisina Dialogue, Gabbard is the first senior official of the Trump administration to travel to India.Drawing from the joint statement issued after the recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump, the discussions reaffirmed the growing strength of the India-US bilateral defence partnership, the ministry said in a statement.“Both leaders emphasised that strategic security remains a vital pillar of the comprehensive global strategic cooperation between the two nations. They reviewed the significant strides made in the areas of military exercises, strategic cooperation, integration of defence industrial supply chains and information-sharing cooperation, especially in the maritime domain,” the statement added.In February, Singh and his US counterpart Pete Hegseth reviewed the ongoing defence cooperation and explored ways and means to expand and deepen the India-US bilateral defence relationship.Both sides have made progress under the US-India Defence Industrial Cooperation Roadmap, including ongoing collaboration to advance priority co-production arrangements for jet engines, munitions, and ground mobility systems.The roadmap, adopted in 2023, seeks to fast-track technology cooperation and co-production in critical areas including air combat and land mobility systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, munitions, and the undersea domain.Last October, India signed a deal worth $3.5 billion with the US to acquire 31 MQ-9B drones to boost its defence preparedness, primarily with an eye on China. The agreement came after a deliberative process in New Delhi that spanned eight years, involved negotiations with two US administrations, incorporated the lease of two drones in this period, and required, at the American end, a challenging process of congressional approval.Fifteen drones are meant for the navy, and eight each for the army and the air force.Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is also negotiating a deal with US firm GE Aerospace for the joint production of F414 engines in India. The two firms signed a memorandum of understanding in Washington in June 2023 to produce 99 F414 engines for India’s future LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-2 programme.The joint production of the engines will help the country overcome a striking technology gap, lay the foundation for indigenous development of bigger jet engines and possibly open doors to exports.Singh’s meeting with Gabbard came a month after Trump revealed that America is paving the way to provide India the F-35 stealth fighters and the two countries announced plans for the co-production of US-made Javelin anti-tank guided missiles and Styker infantry combat vehicles in India during Modi’s visit to the US.In January, the Union home ministry announced that an enquiry committee set up by the Indian government to investigate allegations about a plot to kill Pannun on American soil has recommended legal action against an individual whose “criminal links and antecedents” came to light earlier.The ministry didn’t name the individual against whom the committee recommended legal action or refer to the alleged plot to kill the Pannun. But people familiar with developments said at the time that the individual was Vikash Yadav, named by the US justice department in October 2024 as the Indian official who allegedly directed the plot to kill Pannun.",

Companies are expected to pay for the training and 10 percent of the internship costs from their CSR funds.After the launch of the app, Finance Minister Sitharaman said, \"The government is keeping in mind we need to give that confidence to our youth. We need youth to understand what it takes to get into such top 500 companies.\"She urged the Indian industry to participate in the larger interest of the country's youth.\"That demographic dividend which exists should be available for the industry so that their productivity, their future can be better endowed with our youngsters,\" she added.\"This attempt by the Corporate affairs to make it accessible in all Indian languages in the website is a very good step forward. You cannot limit students to English. Every language in India should have its dominance, especially if the students are from non-metropolitan cities. Now by launching a mobile app, you're making it even more accessible.\"In the July 2024 budget, the BJP-led NDA government announced five different approaches to Viksit Bharat. Among those were measures to promote manufacturing and services through internships.The internship programme was meant for people who, till then, couldn't find an opportunity because either they were not skilled enough or they were not trained enough.

  "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: India plays a key role in the Indo-Pacific since its geo-strategic importance is crucial in an increasingly multipolar world, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Monday as he endorsed New Delhi’s claim for permanent membership of the UN Security Council.Delivering the keynote address at the opening session of the Raisina Dialogue, India’s flagship conference on geopolitics and geo-economics, Luxon emphasised the need for a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific and made it clear that a “might makes right” approach is unacceptable.Luxon made the remarks after inaugurating the Raisina Dialogue along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The fallout of the trade and security policies of the Donald Trump administration in the US, the reshaping of the global order and the conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia are set to dominate this year’s edition of the conference, which is being attended by US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and foreign ministers of about 20 countries, including Ukraine, the Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan and Norway.India plays such a central role globally and New Zealand backs the country’s bid for a permanent seat in a reformed UN Security Council, Luxon told a gathering that included the visiting world leaders, diplomats and officials.“We must go forward with great confidence as we live at the heart of the world’s most exciting and dynamic region – the Indo-Pacific,” he said. “There is no prosperity without security.”New Zealand’s approach towards the Indo-Pacific is also based on safeguarding its interests in a fast evolving dynamic region.“As New Zealand looks to protect and advance our interests in the Indo-Pacific , we can only do so alongside partners like India that have a significant role to play in the Indo-Pacific region,” Luxon said.“In an increasingly multipolar world, India’s size and geo-strategic heft gives you autonomy,” he contended.“We want to live in an Indo-Pacific where the countries are free to choose their own path free from interference, a region where no one country comes to dominate,” Luxon said with an eye on China, whose actions across the region, especially in the context of territorial disputes, have evoked concern.New Zealand, he added, is working with other Pacific Ocean countries to boost capacities and help them in making “independent choices free from interference”.“My government is investing in key relationships – from traditional partners to deepening our relationships across Southeast Asia and in a serious way with India too,” he said.Luxon described the Quad – which groups India, Australia, Japan and the US – as an “important vehicle” to promote an open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific. “And India’s contribution to the evolution of the Quad has been vital,” he said.While New Zealand has no intention of becoming part of the Quad, it is prepared to work to advance the grouping’s initiatives, he indicated.Luxon also said New Zealand will boost defence cooperation with like-minded countries such as India. During talks between Modi and Luxon on Monday, the two sides finalised an agreement for wide-ranging defence cooperation, including joint training and exchanges.The situation in the Indo-Pacific also figured in the talks between Modi and Luxon, and they reaffirmed their commitment to an open, inclusive, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific where sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected, according to a joint statement.The two countries also backed the right of freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas in accordance with international laws, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).",

  "articleBody": "An indigenously developed gene therapy for specific blood cancers has shown a 73 per cent response rate among patients in India, according to results of clinical trials published in The Lancet Haematology journal.Known as 'CAR T-cell therapy', the treatment involves modifying genes in one's T-cells -- a type of immune cells -- to help fight cancer. The study looked at patients with leukaemia, which occurs in bone marrow, and lymphoma, which affects the lymphatic system.Researchers, including those from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay and Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, said in low and middle-income countries, patients in whom 'B-cell' tumours continue to grow following a period of remission (relapse), or do not respond to treatment (refractory), suffer from poor outcomes due to an absence of effective therapies.A type of white blood cell, B-cells are crucial to one's immune system as they produce antibodies to fight infections.\"The clinical trials of India's first gene therapy for cancer offer hopes of another chance to live among these patients, that there is one more drug that doctors can try,\" lead author Rahul Purwar, professor at IIT-Bombay and founder of ImmunoACT, told PTI.'ImmunoACT', or ImmunoAdoptive Cell Therapy Private Limited, is a gene-modified cell therapy company, a spinoff of IIT Bombay.\"CAR T-cells, just like normal T-cells, persist in the body for a long time. These cells help to prevent a relapse,\" first author Dr Hasmukh Jain, professor of medical oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, said.The CAR T-cell therapy is also a cost-effective alternative to that available in the developed world, Purwar added.\"We developed it over a period of 11 years, starting with drug design and lab work, which was then translated into animal studies, before progressing to clinical trials,\" he said.The injection 'talicabtagene autoleucel' is now approved in India, \"available for USD 30,000,\" which is \"less than one-tenth of the price of other approved CD19 CAR T-cell therapy products marketed worldwide\", according to the research article.In a linked commentary article, authors from the University of Pennsylvania in the US -- not involved in the study -- wrote that the approved CAR T-cell products cost USD 3,73,000 to 4,75,000, and clinical care and possible relocation expenses bring the total treatment cost to over USD 1 million.\"Therefore, access to CAR T-cell therapy is an important limitation to the success of this approach in not only high-income countries but particularly in low-income and middle-income countries,\" the research paper said.In phase-1 of the India trials, talicabtagene autoleucel was injected into the veins of 14 patients aged 18 years or older having relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. In phase-2 trials, the drug was given to 50 patients aged 15 years and older with relapsed or refractory B-cell leukaemia or B-cell lymphoma.The typical age of the overall study group was 44 years. Of the 64 patients, 49 were men and 15 women.While phase-1 trials assess a new drug's safety in 20-100 volunteers, along with how the drug is absorbed and metabolised in the body, phase-2 trials involve 100-300 participants for the testing of the new drug's effectiveness.Among the 51 patients analysed, \"the overall response rate was 73 per cent,\" according to the paper.There were two treatment-related deaths, and the most common toxicities were neutropenia (unusually low count of neutrophils), which affected 55 of 57 patients, followed by thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), which affected 37 of them, the team said.Anaemia was found to affect 35 patients.\"Talicabtagene autoleucel had a manageable safety profile and induced durable responses in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies,\" according to the research article.\"This therapy addresses an important unmet need for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies in India,\" it said.Jain said, the findings \"give us an opportunity to test the therapy in the earlier settings and in combination with other immunotherapies\".These trials are now underway at the Tata Memorial Centre, he added.",

  "articleBody": " Nagpur, Tension gripped central Nagpur on Monday when stones were hurled at police amid rumours that the holy book of the Muslim community was burnt during an agitation by a right-wing body for the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb, leaving four persons injured, officials said. Police fired tear gas shells and resorted to cane-charge to disperse the mob in Chitnis Park and Mahal areas. Violence also reportedly spread to Kotwali and Ganeshpeth in the late afternoon, officials said. Officials said the Chitnish Park to Shukrawari Talao road belt was most affected by violence as per the preliminary information, where some four-wheelers were set afire by rioters. Stones were also thrown at the homes of residents. Police are trying to disperse mobs believed to be in thousands. The trouble began late afternoon shortly after Bajrang Dal members demonstrated near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue in Mahal area. According to police, rumours spread that the Quran was burnt during the agitation. Videos of the Bajrang Dal demonstration quickly went viral on social media, leading to outrage among members of the Muslim community. A complaint was lodged at Ganeshpeth police station in the evening alleging the burning of the holy book. Following the complaint, a large number of Muslim community members started gathering in various parts of the city, including Mahal, Kotwali, Ganeshpeth, and Chitanvis Park, police said. Sensing trouble, police intensified patrolling and summoned additional security forces to maintain law and order. An official said stones were thrown at police personnel in Chitnis Park and Mahal areas, following which police fired tear gas shells. An official said there are reports of violence in other areas as well. Bajrang Dal office-bearers, however, refuted the allegations and claimed that they had only burned an effigy of Aurangzeb as part of their demonstration. A senior police official confirmed that security had been tightened in sensitive areas, with Quick Response Teams , Riot Control Police, and the State Reserve Police Force being deployed. Additional police personnel from various stations were also summoned. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.",

  "articleBody": "Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday appeared to lend his support to the Centre’s contentious three-language policy, saying that it was not good to play politics or spread hatred on the issue, and adding that English, Hindi and Telugu were all important.Naidu’s comments come at a time when his Tamil Nadu counterpart, MK Stalin, has repeatedly clashed with the Union government over what he alleges is the Centre trying to impose Hindi on the southern state. Naidu is a key member of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).“It is not good for the country to play politics on language issues or spread hatred against one language. For us, Telugu is our mother tongue. Hindi is a national language and English is an international language,” Naidu said while speaking in the legislative assembly during the discussion on Swarnandhra Vision-2047 document. Swarnandhra Vision-2047 is a programme of the Naidu government, modelled on the central government’s Viksit Bharat-2047, to make Andhra Pradesh a leading state in the country.“I am telling this very clearly to you... language is not for hating.”Also Read | MK Stalin reveals why he replaced 'Rs' with 'Ru' in Tamil Nadu budget logoNaidu said he rejected the argument that knowledge comes only by learning English. “This is not correct. Language is only for communication. It does not impart knowledge. Only people who study in their mother tongue are excelling across the world. It is easy to learn subjects through the mother tongue,” he said.He said that apart from following the three-language formula, people should learn multiple languages which would increase job opportunities in international markets. “Our people are moving to Japan, Germany and other countries and if necessary the local languages are learnt the employment opportunities will be more,” the chief minister said.Naidu underscored that it was important to learn as many languages as possible for livelihood without forgetting the mother tongue, adding that learning the “national language” will enable fluent conversation in Delhi in Hindi.Also Read | NEP row: Ashwini Vaishnaw backs Centre, says PM Modi wants every language to get due respectHis comment came a day after deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan lashed out at the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) which has alleged that the Centre was imposing Hindi on them. “This is not correct. No language can be imposed on anybody and it is not correct to oppose a language blindly. I have never opposed Hindi as a language. I only opposed making it compulsory,” he said.Kalyan said when the New Education Policy 2020 itself did not enforce Hindi, spreading false narratives about its imposition was nothing but an attempt to mislead the public.The controversy came at a time Tamil Nadu has strongly opposed NEP, and said that the three-language policy is a tactic to impose Hindi in a state with a strong regional identity.Stalin and Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan have sparred repeatedly over language and the implementation of NEP in the state, including last week. Stalin also said that the Union government was sowing the seeds of another language war and that Tamil Nadu was ready for it. Language has long been an emotive issue for the state that was rocked by anti-Hindi agitation in the 1960s.The issue also rocked Parliament last week after Pradhan said that the DMK refused to implement the NEP for “politics”, prompting a strong reaction from Stalin, who accused the minister of “arrogance” and asked him to“control his tongue”. Last week, Tamil Nadu replaced the rupee symbol ( ₹) with a Tamil alphabet (translated as Ru) for the logo of the state budget 2025-26.Naidu advocated multi-language policy in the past as well, including the recent media conclave in Delhi. He never spoke against Hindi in the past. ",

  "articleBody": "Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha MP Ashok Kumar Mittal on Monday praised the central government for its efforts to rename colonial-era places and sought further changes to other such places to shed the British legacy. Mittal expressed concern over what he described as “carrying the burden” of colonial-era names, which he feels symbolise India’s past under the British rule. He appreciated the government’s initiatives, citing examples such as the renaming of Rajpath to Kartavya Path, the Indian Penal Code to Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Allahabad to Prayagraj. “These steps reflect a nationalistic thought process and are crucial in shedding the colonial mindset,” he said during the Zero Hour discussions in the House. The AAP MP further pointed out that several institutions, roads and landmarks still bear British-era names. Highlighting his recent visit to Prayagraj for the Maha Kumbh, Mittal noted, “The city has been renamed, but its high court and a prestigious university still carry the name ‘Allahabad’. Even the Lok Sabha constituency continues to be named Allahabad instead of Prayagraj.” Raising concerns about the conservation of colonial-era monuments, Mittal questioned the continued prominence of sites associated with British officers such as Warren Hastings and Lieutenant CA Edwards. “These places are being equated with national heritage sites like the Taj Mahal, which is problematic,” he remarked. Mittal urged state governments to take initiative in renaming institutions within their respective states that still retain colonial names. He also called for the formation of a parliamentary committee to examine and recommend further renaming efforts. This comes in the backdrop of senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh criticising the Centre’s efforts to rename places, including those from the Mughal era. During a press conference on March 7, Singh accused the central government of using historical revisionism as a “smokescreen” to divert the public attention from crucial issues such as inflation, unemployment and the wealth gap. The renaming of places and institutions is part of the BJP-led central government’s broader initiative to shed India’s colonial past. The move aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s emphasis on eliminating the “colonial mindset” and reinstating Indian heritage in the country’s identity. ",

  "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Beijing on Monday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on India-China cooperation being essential for global stability and prosperity, and said the Chinese side stands ready to work with New Delhi to rebuild bilateral ties. Modi said in a podcast aired on Sunday that differences between neighbours such as India and China are natural, but these shouldn’t turn into disputes since bilateral cooperation is necessary for global stability and prosperity. He acknowledged that incidents on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in 2020 created “significant tensions” and said the two sides are working to normalise their relationship. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning responded to Modi’s remarks at a media briefing in Beijing on Monday by describing them as “positive” and saying that China is prepared to work with India to rebuild the relationship. “China stands ready to work with India to implement the important common understandings between [Modi and President Xi Jinping], take the 75th anniversary of China-India diplomatic relations as an opportunity, promote exchange and cooperation in various fields and at all levels, and advance China-India relations on the track of sound and stable development,” Mao said. China appreciates Modi’s “positive statements” on bilateral relations, and the successful meeting between Xi and Modi in Kazan last October “provided strategic guidance” for improving and developing bilateral ties, she said. “Both sides have earnestly followed through on the important common understandings of our leaders, strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels, and achieved a series of positive outcomes,” she said.Last October, India and China reached an understanding on ending the military face-off along the LAC, which was triggered by skirmishes between troops in Ladakh sector in April-May 2020. The understanding was followed by the meeting between Modi and Xi in the Russian city of Kazan, and the two leaders agreed to revive several mechanisms to address the border dispute and normalise ties.Mao also reiterated Modi’s remarks that India and China have no history of conflict in their relations going back thousands of years, and said the “mainstream of China-India interactions has been friendly exchanges and mutual learning”. She said China and India, as the two largest developing countries, “should understand and support each other, and help each other succeed”. This serves the interests of more than 2.8 billion people in the two countries, “meets the common aspiration of regional countries, follows the historical trend of the Global South growing stronger, and is conducive to world peace, stability, development and prosperity”, she added.“The two countries should be partners that contribute to each other’s success. A cooperative pas de deux [dance for two] of the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for both sides,” Mao said, repeating a phrase used by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi earlier this month.Modi also said in the podcast that India has emphasised dialogue, instead of discord, with China to build a stable cooperative relationship. “Instead of discord, we emphasise dialogue, because only through dialogue can we have a stable cooperative relationship that is in the best interests of both nations,” he said. Following his meeting with Xi last October, the two sides have seen a return to normalcy at the border and are now working to “restore conditions to how they were before 2020”, Modi said. “Our cooperation isn’t just beneficial, it’s necessary for global stability and prosperity...Competition is not a bad thing but there should not be conflict,” he added.",

  "articleBody": " Chandigarh, The executive committee of the SGPC on Monday rejected the resignation of Harjinder Singh Dhami as the president of the apex gurdwara body, and appealed to him to immediately resume his duties. The executive committee of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee , which met here under the leadership of its senior vice-president Raghujit Singh Virk, unanimously decided to reject Dhami's resignation. Dhami resigned as SGPC president last month after the then Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh condemned the dismissal of Giani Harpreet Singh as the jathedar of Damdama Sahib at Talwandi Sabo near Bathinda. Virk said in a statement that after rejecting Dhami's resignation, all the members of the executive committee will visit his residence in Hoshiarpur and request him to immediately take charge of his role as the SGPC chief. Virk also shared some other decisions taken at the meeting, including the approval to form a committee of scholars to review the Centre's New Education Policy in light of the message delivered by Jathedar of Akal Takht and Takht Kesgarh Sahib, Giani Kuldeep Singh Gargaj, on the occasion of the Sikh festival of Hola Mohalla. Gargaj had said that a panel would evaluate what reforms were necessary in the New Education Policy in the context of Punjab. The committee will also deliberate on the current challenges facing the Gurmukhi language and the recommendations to be taken up with the Centre. Virk said as per the jathedars' orders, the SGPC will launch a religious campaign on April 13 on the occasion of 'Khalsa Sajna Diwas' , which will reach every household. To mark its launch, 'Amrit Sanchar' ceremonies will be held at the Takhts, where thousands will be initiated into Sikh faith. At Takht Kesgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib, the 'Amrit Sanchar' will be performed using the historical 'Khanda' of Guru Gobind Singh, Virk said. This year, the 350th martyrdom anniversary of Guru Tegh Bahadur and the 350th Guruship centenary of the 10 Sikh master, Guru Gobind Singh, are being commemorated according to 'Panthic' traditions, and the religious campaign will be dedicated to these historic events, he added.

  "articleBody": "China on Monday expressed “appreciation” for Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remark on India-China ties on Lex Fridman's podcast, saying a cooperative dance between the elephant and dragon is the only choice for both nations.Reacting to PM Modi's positive statement on India-China relations, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said her country noted the statement and appreciated it.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking on the Lex Fridman podcast, emphasised strengthening the relations between India and China, saying that competition should not turn into conflicts and differences shouldn't be replaced by disputes.\"If you look at historical records, for centuries, India and China have learned from each other. Together, they have always contributed to the global good in some way. Old records suggest that at one point, India and China alone accounted for more than 50 per cent of the world's GDP. That's how massive India's contribution was. And I believe our ties have been extremely strong, with deep cultural connections,\" the Prime Minister told Lex Fridman.Also read: ‘Dialogue over discord’: PM Modi responds to Lex Fridman's India-China questionPM Modi acknowledged that there were some differences between the two nations.\"But our focus is to ensure that these differences don't turn into disputes. That's what we actively work toward,\" the PM said.Mao said the successful meeting between Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan, Russia, in October provided strategic guidance for the improvement and development of bilateral ties.Both sides have earnestly followed through on the important common understandings, strengthened exchanges and achieved positive outcomes, she added.\"Let me stress that in the 2000 plus years’ history of interactions, the two countries have maintained friendly exchanges” and both the countries learned from each other contributing to civilisational achievements and human progress, she said.She said India and China should be partners that contribute to each other's success. She said the only choice for both sides is to hold a ballet dance between dragon and elephant.China stands ready to work with India to implement the important common understandings between the two leaders, take the 75th anniversary of the diplomatic relations as an opportunity and advance bilateral ties on the track of stable and sound development, she added.On the podcast, PM Modi lambasted Pakistan saying India's efforts to promote peace were frustrated by the country's betrayal and hostility.With inputs from PTI",

  "articleBody": "Gujarat minister Harsh Sanghavi on Monday slammed the Congress for the party's government in Karnataka approving a decision to give 4 per cent quota to Muslims in public contracts. The move has exposed the Congress' ideology and the mentality of its leaders, the Gujarat Minister of State for Home asserted. The government in the southern state on Friday approved an amendment to Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (KTPP) Act in order to reserve 4 per cent of contracts in (civil) works valued up to ₹2 crore and goods/services contracts of up to ₹1 crore for Muslims. \"Congress leaders in other states are having the same mentality and they are working on the same mission. The Congress government has passed a Bill in Karnataka for providing 4 per cent reservation to Muslims in government works and tenders. Through this Bill, the Congress has exposed its ideology and mentality of its leaders,\" Sanghavi told reporters. \"This is perhaps for the first time in the country that such a decision has been taken by a state government. Though the Congress government in Karnataka does not have funds to fulfil its pre-poll promises, the party wants to give benefits to a specific community while doing injustice to all others,\" he said. Sanghavi said the decision is highly condemnable and prayed that good sense prevails.",

  "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The persecution and killing of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh is a concern for the Trump administration in the US, which is determined to tackle Islamist terrorism around the globe, US Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard said on Monday.Gabbard, who is in India to attend a conclave of security and intelligence officials and participate in the Raisina Dialogue, also spoke in media interviews about the Trump administration’s efforts to work with partners such as India to tackle challenges related to China. She is the first senior member of the Trump administration to travel to India. “The long-time unfortunate persecution and killing and abuse of religious minorities – Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Catholics and others – has been a major area of concern for the US government and President Trump and his administration,” she told NDTV news channel. Talks are “just beginning” between Trump’s new cabinet and the Bangladesh government, she said without giving details. Her comments came against the backdrop of India repeatedly expressing concern about Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, failing to prevent the targeting of the country’s minorities and the rise of extremist elements. “This continues to remain a central focus area of concern...with the threat of Islamist terrorists and...the global effort of these different groups that are rooted in their same ideology, their same objective, which is to rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate,” she said.“This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than one that they find acceptable, and they choose to carry this out through very violent and terroristic means,” she said, adding that Trump is committed to identifying and defeating the ideology that drives Islamist terrorism.While Bangladesh has witnessed a spurt in activities of hardline religious groups such as Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which recently held its first public rally since 2009, none of these forces has publicly called for an Islamic caliphate.Responding to a question about India and China working together in the face of an expansionist China, Gabbard said both countries are strengthening their partnership as their mutual interests are centred around peace, prosperity, freedom and security. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are leaders “who are very good friends and...very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests”, she said. Gabbard, who met Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday, said the Indian premier’s visit to Washington in February set the tone and vision for a stronger India-US partnership. Modi was the first world leader to meet Gabbard shortly after she was officially sworn-in as DNI. She also said that as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to defeat Islamist terrorism, the US has re-designated the Houthis in Yemen as a terror group and is taking action to prevent them from disrupting maritime trade.“Our country and other countries should not be in a position to have to make a decision to reroute commerce going through that area simply because of the Houthi threat,” she said. Trump also perceives the Russia-Ukraine conflict with clear eyes and his priority is to “bring about an end to this war”, Gabbard said. “So he is focused on peace. The negotiations have just begun. He’s looking forward to success in those negotiations, not for himself, but for the cause of peace and to stop the killing of...innocent lives there,” she said.Under the previous Biden administration, there was “no effort to have direct dialogue with [President Vladimir] Putin and with Russia to try to bring about an end to this war. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace,” she said. In the context of US threats to impose reciprocal tariffs on trade partners from April 2, Gabbard said in an interview with ANI that there are opportunities for strengthening the bilateral economic relationship. “When we look at tariffs, obviously, Prime Minister Modi is looking out for what is in the best interests of India and the opportunities available for the people of India. Similarly, President Trump is doing the same for the US’s economic interests and the interests of the American people,” she said. Both leaders “have common sense and...are looking for good solutions”, she added. The direct dialogue between the two countries will lay down the path forward, she added. Gabbard also told ANI that both Trump and Modi are very practical and pragmatic about striking a balance in the Indo-Pacific region and preventing any kind of conflict. “Obviously as it relates to China, there are challenges and there are also opportunities and we have two leaders...who will play a very central role in taking on those challenges, resolving issues where they exist and maximising any opportunities,” she said.",

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, The Supreme Court on Monday issued a contempt notice to the principal secretary of Delhi government’s home department for not deciding the remission plea of a convict in the 2002 Nitish Katara murder case and said its orders were not followed unless drastic measures were taken. “We believe that unless a contempt notice is issued, our orders are not complied with,” a bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said after the Delhi government failed to take a decision on the grant of remission to convict Sukhdev Yadav alias Pehalwan, who is serving a 20-year jail term without remission in the case. Referring to its previous order, the bench said, “A solemn statement on instructions of the state government was recorded in the order. Now we are informed that the SRB is to consider the case of the petitioner today. The state government has not shown even the elementary courtesy of even making an application for grant of extension of time.” The bench went on, “We therefore issue notice to the principal secretary of the Home Department of Delhi government calling upon him to show cause why action under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 should not be initiated against him. Notice of contempt is made returnable on March 28.” The official was asked to remain present via video-conferencing on the next hearing. On March 3, the Delhi government informed the bench that it would take a decision on the grant of remission to the convict in two weeks. During the hearing, additional solicitor general Archana Pathak Dave, appearing for the Delhi government, said a meeting of the SRB was scheduled during the day and sought more time for a decision on the remission. “We have seen that the Delhi government does not make a decision without extension of time ... .We are seeing it in every case. Earlier there was an excuse that the chief minister was unavailable,” Justice Oka said. When the law officer persisted with the request, the judge said, “You don't even have the courtesy to apply for extension of time.” The bench referred to the prior statement of the government on a decision in two weeks but said it has now learnt that the SRB did not consider it. The government referred to the Delhi High Court’s direction on the aspect of the complainant, Neelam Katara, mother of the deceased victim, being heard during the hearing of the convict's remission plea. “Is there a rule with the Delhi government that whenever the Supreme Court passes an order to decide a case it will not be decided within the time?” the bench asked. “Unless there is a threat of contempt, you will never decide a case,” Justice Oka added. On being informed that the SRB was meeting during the day, Justice Oka said “Now it will go to the chief minister then to the Governor. Please tell us who is in-charge of this department. We will issue contempt notice.” Issuing the contempt notice, the bench said it did not compel the government to make the statement on taking a decision on the remission plea. The bench previously asked the government how the convict, whose 20 years jail term was ending on March 10, 2025, would continue to remain in prison. “After all, the issue pertains to the liberty of a person,\" the bench then said. Justice Oka had said the process of granting the remission should have been started long ago. \"How can he be kept in jail after the period of sentence is over?\" he asked. The bench had noted the submissions of solicitor general Tushar Mehta and recorded that the aspect of remission would be considered within two weeks. On February 24, the bench questioned the Delhi government's submission that it would not release Pehalwan even after the completion of his actual 20 years jail term in the case. The bench perused its judgement, which said, \"Life imprisonment which shall be 20 years of actual imprisonment without consideration of remission, and fine of ₹10,000.\" The top court then ordered the Delhi government home department secretary to file a statement on oath on whether after completing 20 years of actual sentence, the petitioner should be released and asked its counsel if the state was reading court verdicts this way. Yadav's plea challenged a November 2024 order of the Delhi High Court, which dismissed his petition for releasing him on furlough for three weeks. On October 3, 2016, the Supreme Court awarded a 25-year jail term without the benefit of remission to Vikas Yadav and his cousin Vishal for their role in the sensational kidnapping and killing of Katara. Co-convict Sukhdev Yadav alias Pehalwan was given a 20-year jail term in the case. They were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping Katara from a marriage party on the intervening night of February 16-17, 2002 and then killing him for his alleged affair with Vikas' sister Bharti Yadav. Bharti was the daughter of Uttar Pradesh politician D P Yadav. The trial court observed Katara was murdered as Vishal and Vikas Yadav did not approve of his affair with Bharti as they were from different castes.

  "articleBody": "Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday clarified that no memorandums were submitted during his recent meeting with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, describing it as simply a \"breakfast meeting\". Speaking during the discussion on demands for grants in the Assembly, Vijayan mentioned that several issues concerning Kerala were discussed, some of which the Finance Minister acknowledged as serious, and termed the meeting as \"very friendly.\" The CM further said Governor Rajendra Arlekar had initially invited him to a banquet for MPs from the state in New Delhi, but he had conveyed to the latter his inability to attend. \"We were on the same flight to Delhi when the Governor once again invited me to attend the banquet,\" he said. Coincidentally, I was in Delhi for the party's Polit Bureau meeting, so I attended the event and informed the Governor that Nirmala Sitharaman would be attending a breakfast meeting the following day, he added. \"Governor expressed his desire to join as well... I did not attend the meeting based on any arrangement made by the Governor,\" the Chief Minister clarified. \"Politics does not simply dissolve when personalities with differing ideologies meet.\" Also Read: MK Stalin reveals why he replaced 'Rs' with 'Ru' in Tamil Nadu budget logoEarlier, in his speech, Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala questioned the secrecy surrounding Vijayan’s meeting with Sitharaman, alleging that the discussion was mediated by the Governor and had significant political implications. \"The people of Kerala deserve to know what was discussed in the \"unofficial\" meeting,\" he said, accusing the CPI(M) of \"forging\" a secret alliance with the RSS and BJP. However, defending the CPI(M)’s stance, Vijayan justified labelling the central government as \"fascist,\" emphasising that the right to live is paramount in a democratic set-up. \"There was a time in India when all fundamental rights were taken away—that was during the Emergency,\" he recalled. The CM added that the CPI(M) had described it as an excessive use of power adding that their choice of words is based on careful judgment. Vijayan, who is also a Polit Bureau member of CPI(M), alleged that it was Congress-led UDF that forged ties with RSS in the elections. “We have not taken such a political stance ever,” he said.",

  "articleBody": "Out of 406 cities where PM 2.5 –– fine, respirable particles that are less than 2.56 micron in diameter –– pollution is monitored, only 214 are complying with national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), the Union environment ministry informed the Lok Sabha on March 17, highlighting the extent of the bad air crisis in the country. Responding to questions from Congress MP and Leader of Opposition, Rahul Gandhi, the minister of state for environment Kirti Vardhan Singh said: “Air quality monitoring is carried out by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB) in 551 cities in the Country. Out of 406 cities measured for PM 2.5 levels in 2023, 214 cities are complying with National Ambient Air Quality Standards. He provided the list of cities by states and UTs where air quality monitoring is carried out; the guidelines for criteria for setting up of air quality monitoring stations; and the list of cities shortlisted for expansion of air quality monitoring network.SPCBs and Pollution Control Committees (PCC) have prepared plan for the expansion of air quality monitoring network in additional 119 cities, Singh added.The NAAQS standard for PM 2.5 is 40 micrograms per cubic metres annually and 60 micrograms per cubic metres daily (in a 24 hour period).India’s annual PM 2.5 concentration was over 10 times the safe limit at 50.6 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) in 2024 compared to 54.4µg/m3 in 2023, according to Swiss air quality technology firm IQAir’s “World Air Quality Report 2024” released last week. The report said Byrnihat on the Assam-Meghalaya border topped the list as it recorded an annual PM 2.5 concentration of 128.2µg/m3. New Delhi (91.8µg/m3) had a higher annual PM 2.5 concentration than N’Djamena, the capital of Chad, (91.6µg/m3) and Dhaka in Bangladesh (78µg/m3).HT, on July 20, 2024, reported that road dust mitigation has been the primary focus of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which was launched in 2019 as the first such effort to set clean air targets for 131 polluted cities and to reduce particulate pollution nationally, with much lower funding for combustion sources that emit pollutants, as per an analysis by a Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) assessment. NCAP was originally planned to tackle both PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in the 131 non-attainment cities. In practice, only PM10 concentration has been considered for performance assessment.“The NCAP needs to take PM 2.5 as the benchmark for assessing progress of air pollution control. PM 2.5 is more harmful and it is mainly a result of combustion sources. The health benefits are higher when PM 2.5 is taken as benchmark. We are also noticing non-NCAP cities where pollution is problem. It will be better if NCAP has a much wider focus and state and regional clean air action plan are prioritised,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, CSE.HT reported last July that air pollution could cause deaths even at levels much lower than what is considered the Indian national standard, according to a study published in Lancet Planetary Health.The report found that across 10 major cities in India — Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Shimla, and Varanasi – around 33,000 deaths every year are attributable to PM 2.5 pollution levels that breach the WHO guideline of only 15 micrograms per cubic metres.

  "articleBody": " New Delhi, Delhi Police has arrested a key associate of Neeraj Bawana gang after a shootout in Pul Prahladpur area of southeast Delhi, an official said on Monday. The accused, identified as 24-year-old Shubham from Jangpura area, was caught with a pistol and a stolen motorcycle. \"Acting on secret information, a team set up a vehicle checkpoint on MB road on March 16. Around 10:30 pm, Shubham was spotted riding a motorcycle from the Badarpur side. When signalled to stop, he attempted to flee but lost control and fell,\" said Deputy Commissioner of Police , Southeast, Ravi Kumar Singh. The officer said that instead of surrendering, he fired two bullet rounds at the police, hitting constable Ashish, who was saved by his bulletproof jacket. In retaliation, the police fired two rounds, injuring Shubham in the leg. He was taken to the AIIMS for treatment, he added. A pistol with two live cartridges and a stolen motorcycle were recovered from him. During interrogation, Shubham revealed his ties with Shibbu and Neeraj Bawana gang, which has been involved in extortion, property disputes, gambling and drug rackets across south and southeast Delhi, police said. \"Shubham was closely associated with Naveen Bhanja, a member of the Bawana gang. Shibbu joined the gang seven years ago to establish control over crime in the region, but internal conflicts led to a violent gang war with Rohit Jat, a former ally who split from the group in 2020,\" said the DCP. Shubham had been involved in multiple violent incidents, including a 2023 attempt to murder Rohit Jat. In 2024, Rohit's gang tried to kill Abhishek Katiya, a close aide of Shibbu, but he survived. In retaliation, Shubham and his associates ambushed Rohit and his ally Abhishek Piddi outside a court, he added. While several gang members were arrested, Shubham remained on the run, hiding in Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, police said, adding he was also associated with Shibbu gang earlier. \"Shubham has a history of four criminal cases, including attempted murder and arms-related offenses. Further investigation into the matter is underway,\" said the DCP. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.",

  "articleBody": " Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh Police chief Prashant Kumar on Monday directed senior officials to enhance vigilance and intelligence gathering regarding attendees at various religious events in the state. According to an official statement, a directive in this regard was issued to all police commissioners, additional directors general, regional inspectors general, deputy inspectors general, and district superintendents. The move comes in response to reports from the Special Task Force indicating that criminals often used religious gatherings as cover to evade arrest after committing crimes, it said. In several cases, hardened criminals have used such events to escape police action. In light of this, Director General of Police Kumar has instructed that personnel should maintain strict vigilance on individuals travelling from different districts and states to attend religious events. The STF findings suggested that some criminals took refuge at these gatherings to avoid detection. The DGP noted that Sunil Kumar, a police inspector, was martyred during a recent encounter with a criminal in Shamli district. Investigations later revealed that the accused had used religious congregations to evade law enforcement. District intelligence units and social media monitoring cells should be activated to track movements of individuals attending such programmes, he said. Local police units must coordinate closely to identify any suspicious persons, he added. Authorities should liaise with event organisers to collect detailed records of attendees, ensuring that such information was available to law enforcement when needed, the DGP said. A register of attendees should be made in which their details, including valid identification such as Aadhaar, according to the directive. It mandates monthly inspections to verify the backgrounds of individuals, ensuring no criminal elements are exploiting these events for shelter. Police officials have been instructed to enforce these measures strictly, ensuring that religious events are not misused by criminal elements while maintaining public safety and order.

  "articleBody": "The ministry of external affairs on Monday told Parliament that India had formally asked the U.S. Embassy to urgently furnish details of expenditure incurred on all USAID assisted/funded projects in the country over the last ten years in view of the recent reports regarding their activities. In a written reply to CPI(M) Rajya Sabha member John Brittas, the ministry said the government had also sought information on the NGOs involved in implementing USAID-backed initiatives in the country. “In view of the recent reports regards USAID funding in India, the Ministry of External Affairs has formally asked the U.S. Embassy to urgently furnish details of expenditure incurred on all USAID assisted/funded projects in India over the last ten years,” the ministry said. “While there is some open-source information available on this matter, the Government of India understandably expects an official response from the US Government on this matter,” it added. The MEA noted that certain details about USAID beneficiaries have been withheld by the US administration, citing legal provisions under American law that allow “exceptional redactions.” “As per that legislation, the exceptional redactions include information that would jeopardise the health or security of an implementing partner or program beneficiary. Another justification is a determination that the information online would be detrimental to the national interests of the United States,” the ministry noted. The CPI(M) MP had referred to reports alleging the use of United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funds to influence voter turnout in Indian elections. The controversy erupted after the Elon Musk-led US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) announced budget cuts for USAID on February 16, including a contentious $21 million allegedly allocated for voter mobilisation efforts in India. The issue further escalated with repeated claims by US President Donald Trump that his predecessor, Joe Biden, had sanctioned funds to influence India’s electoral process. Amid the controversy, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on February 21 that President Trump’s claim regarding the $21 million was “very deeply troubling.” He added that it had “raised concerns about foreign interference in India’s internal affairs.” The following day, on February 22, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar mentioned that the government was investigating the matter and assured that “the facts will come out soon.” “The USAID was allowed to operate here in good faith to undertake positive activities. However, suggestions are emerging from America that there are actions being taken in bad faith,” the EAM remarked at a public event. Additionally, the annual report by the Union Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs indicated that a total of seven projects, worth $750 million, were being jointly implemented by USAID and the Union government for the fiscal year 2023-24. These projects are focused on various sectors including agriculture, food security, climate adaptation, water, sanitation, renewable energy, health, disaster management and energy efficiency technology.

  "articleBody": " A clutch of BJP leaders including state president K Annamalai and former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan were detained hours before they were to protest against the findings of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that there have been irregularities to the tune of 1000 crore after the raids in Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC). They were released later in the evening.Annamalai was detained while he was leaving his residence in Chennai’s Akkarai to proceed towards TASMAC’s headquarters in Egmore in the city. Soundararajan was also detained from her home. Besides them, the party’s Mahila Morcha head and Coimbatore South MLA Vanathi Srinivasan, MLA C Saraswathi, senior leader H Raja, the party’s youth wing head in Tamil Nadu P Vinoj were also detained in various locations across the city.Annamalai called the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), an autocratic government for using the state police department to prevent the BJP’s protest. “People of Tamil Nadu know that the accused number 1 in the TASMAC Liquor scam is TN CM Thiru (MK Stalin) @mkstalin,” he wrote in a post on X, adding, “We will continue to protest against this corrupt, tyrannical DMK govt. How long will you keep arresting us?”Annamalai also said that though the ED has quantified the alleged irregularities in TASMAC at ₹1,000 crore, he estimates it to be ₹40,000 crore.“This ₹1000 crore is the tip of the iceberg,” Annamalai told reporters. “This protest will not only shake up Tamil Nadu politics but will pave the way for ushering in good politics. My estimate is this scam will be worth ₹40,000 crore. But I am in a responsible position, so I am quoting the ₹1,000 crore mentioned by the ED.”TASMAC has a monopoly over liquor sales in Tamil Nadu and is the cash cow for any party that forms the government. The Enforcement Directorate on March 13 said that incriminating data related to transfer postings, transport tender, bar licence tender, indent orders favouring few distillery companies, excess charge of ₹10-30 per bottle by TASMAC were recovered during raids conducted in Chennai on March 6. TASMAC comes under Senthil Balaji who is minister for excise besides electricity. Balaji is currently out on bail after being arrested by the ED in 2023 in another money laundering case involving jobs in the transport department.DMK’s ally Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), a staunch critic of the BJP and who are for prohibition, extended their support to their rival party’s protest. “Maybe the police action was from the law and order point of view,” said VCK chief and Lok Sabha MP, Thol Thirumavalavan. “Our stand is that liquor shops in Tamil Nadu should be closed down and we will welcome anyone who supports that.”",
