      "Last week, federal immigration authorities arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student and Palestinian activist at Columbia University who played a prominent role in the institution’s protests against Israel. At the time of the arrest, Khalil was inside his university-owned apartment on Saturday night when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took him into custody, his attorney Amy Greer told The Associated Press.",
      "During a phone call with one of the ICE agents, Greer was told that they were executing State Department orders to revoke Khalil’s student visa. When she told the authorities that the Columbia graduate was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, they told her that they were revoking that instead. Confirming Khalil’s arrest, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security later described it as being “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.”",
      "Also read | Coffee creamer recall: ‘Complaints of illness’ land over 75K bottles with 2nd-highest risk classification",
      "On Sunday evening, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a message on X that the administration “will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”",
      "Consequently, Columbia University released an official statement on the current state of affairs, with Khalil’s arrest being documented as the first publicly known deportation effort as Donald Trump previously promised a crackdown on students who participated in college campus protests against the war in Gaza last spring.",
      "On March 14, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism faculty defended press freedom, saying that being “a bedrock principle of American democracy,” it is under threat in the US.",
      "“Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism we are witnessing and experiencing an alarming chill. We write to affirm our commitment to supporting and exercising First Amendment rights for students, faculty, and staff on our campus — and, indeed, for all,” began the lengthy response.",
      "Alluding to the detainment of Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia's School of Public and International Affairs, without being charged with any crime, the university divulged that many of their international students’ anxieties have caused them to even skip out on attending classes and events on campus.",
      "“They are right to be worried. Some of our faculty members and students who have covered the protests over the Gaza war have been the object of smear campaigns and targeted on the same sites that were used to bring Khalil to the attention of Homeland Security. President Trump has warned that the effort to deport Khalil is just the first of many,” the university added.",
      "“These actions represent threats against political speech and the ability of the American press to do its essential job and are part of a larger design to silence voices that are out of favour with the current administration. We have also seen reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is trying to deport the Palestinian poet and journalist Mosab Abu Toha, who has written extensively in the New Yorker about the condition of the residents of Gaza and warned of the mortal danger to Palestinian journalists.”",
      "Citing Khalil’s example, Columbia University stated that all thirteen million legal residents (green card holders) in the US will now live in fear “if they dare speak up or publish something that runs afoul of government views.” Beginning with Khalil’s detainment, the university said the Trump admin “meant to intimidate others into self-censorship.”",
      "“The use of deportation to suppress foreign critics runs parallel to an aggressive campaign to use libel laws in novel — even outlandish ways — to silence or intimidate the independent press,” noted Columbia, while listing other examples of how media was either favourably speaking about Trump or was vulnerable to being sued, like CBS faced the legal wrath for an interview with Kamala Harris.",
      "“Meanwhile, the Trump administration insists on hand-picking the journalists who will be permitted to cover the White House and Pentagon, and it has banned the Associated Press from press briefings because the AP is following its own style book and refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America,” the leading university said.",

All who believe in these freedoms should steadfastly oppose the intimidation, harassment, and detention of individuals on the basis of their speech or their journalism,” the uni faculty signed off.",

      "Samah Sisa, a staff attorney at the Centre for Constitutional Rights, also said at a press conference on Friday, “Mahmoud was moved across multiple state lines and subsequently transferred to a remote prison in Louisiana hours after filing his habeas petition, an intentional and retaliatory act and an attempt to interfere with the jurisdiction of the New York court.”",
      "On the other hand, Khalil’s attorneys have maintained that his campus activism has been in support of Palestinian rights and he doesn’t have any ties to Hamas."

During the 1980s and 1990s, legends such as Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar, Waqar Younis, Shoaib Akhtar, Shahid Afridi, Javed Miandad, and Saqlain Mushtaq struck fear into the hearts of international teams – particularly arch-rivals India. These players defined an era of dominance, but over time, cricket’s prominence in Pakistan has steadily declined, and the evidence is unmistakable.",
      "The national team’s recent performances paint a grim picture of inconsistency. Early exits in the group stages of the 2023 ODI World Cup, the 2024 T20 World Cup, and now the Champions Trophy underscore this downward trend. A home Test series defeat to Bangladesh further exposed the team’s struggles. While a Test series victory against England on home soil offers a rare bright spot, even that triumph was overshadowed by a last-minute decision to alter the pitch conditions – a move that raised more questions than it answered.",
      "The Pakistan cricket team’s lacklustre performances have cast a harsh spotlight on the administrators of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Over the past three to four years, the PCB has experienced a revolving door of leadership, with multiple individuals stepping into the chairman’s role. Notable names like Ramiz Raja, Najam Sethi, Zaka Ashraf, and Mohsin Naqvi have each taken their turn at the helm of this prestigious position, yet stability remains elusive.",
      "Ehsan Mani, who served as PCB chairman from 2018 to 2021, offered his perspective on the situation in an interview with Hindustan Times. He emphasised that Pakistan is not lacking in talent; rather, the key lies in bringing order to the cricketing ecosystem. According to Mani, the potential is there. It’s simply a matter of getting the house in order.",

I had started the process by introducing a new format for first-class cricket, and in fact, for all forms of cricket in Pakistan, based on provincial teams,\" said Mani.",
      "\"What we are having in Pakistan is a lot of cricket but very little quality cricket. And I think people have to go back to the point of ensuring that the basic structure of the game in Pakistan is fit for purpose and suitable for modern-day requirements. Well, PCB needs to go back and look at the whole game structure in Pakistan. Make sure there's high-quality, competitive cricket being played, which is not the case today in Pakistan.\"",
      "In recent years, Pakistan’s cricket team has seen its captaincy resemble a game of musical chairs. The leadership baton first passed to Babar Azam, then to Shaheen Shah Afridi, only to return to Babar again. This cycle unfolded between the 2023 ODI World Cup and the T20 World Cup eight months later in the USA and Caribbean, reflecting a lack of continuity at the top. Adding to the turbulence coaches Gary Kirsten and Jason Gillespie stepped down from their roles with the white-ball and red-ball teams, respectively. Gillespie, in particular, has not held back in his criticism, openly questioning Aaqib Javed’s appointment as coach and the process that led to it.",

There must be consistency in that, and there must be clarity of the way forward for the team as a whole,\" he stated.",

It shouldn't be left to one person. It should be a collective issue of the whole Pakistan cricket board,\" added the 79-year-old.",

Afridi went further, declaring that the sport in Pakistan is in critical condition, likening it to a patient in the ICU, and insisted that accountability is overdue. In contrast, Mani takes a different stance, brushing aside the naysayers. He believes that strong leadership from the chairman is the key, and once that’s in place, everything else will naturally fall into line.",
      "\"I do not give any credibility to what Shahid Afridi or anyone else says. They have their personal agendas or whatever. So I wouldn't go there. No comment on that. All I would say is that leadership must come from the chairman and from the board of directors of PCB. For the rest, I don't give much credibility to these criticisms,\" said Mani.",
      "Pakistan hosted the ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025 under a hybrid model, with India’s matches shifted to Dubai. The tournament schedule, however, was only unveiled a mere two months prior, a decision that left former PCB chairman Ehsan Mani unimpressed with the ICC’s management of the eight-team event.",
      "\"It's very disappointing the way it was managed. The responsibility for this is with the ICC. When they allocated events to India and Pakistan, knowing the current relations between the countries, then the onus was entirely on the ICC to ensure that the event and the issues that came up had been dealt with much, much before the tournament actually was starting,\" said Mani, who served as the ICC President for the period between 2003 to 2006.",
      "\"This was left to the 11th hour. It was totally wrong of the ICC not to have dealt with this much, much earlier. Got both the boards together and come up with an ICC solution, not a PCB or BCCI solution.\"",
      "Mani brushed off claims that India gained an edge by playing all their matches in Dubai during the ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025. Despite India’s triumphant campaign, concerns were raised about this perceived advantage, arguing that Rohit Sharma and his team benefited disproportionately from familiar conditions. Mani, however, remained unconvinced by the narrative.",
      "\"The pitch was the same for all the teams playing there. Yes, BCCI played in one ground for all these matches, but that was something that the ICC had decided right from the outset they would do that. There's no point of being critical about that later on,\" said Mani.",
      "Ahead of the Champions Trophy, the ICC declared that matches between India and Pakistan scheduled in either country during ICC events within the 2024-2027 rights cycle would take place at neutral venues. As a result, Pakistan will now play their T20 World Cup 2026 matches in Sri Lanka instead of India, marking a significant shift in the tournament’s planning.",
      "\"It's not a matter of ICC. This is really a BCCI call, isn't it? They decided they won't tour Pakistan. Pakistan agreed to tour for the World Cup and BCCI didn't deliver what was agreed when I was chairman of PCB. If you look at the ICC minutes, there are recorded assurances that the BCCI and the Government of India would ensure that adequate visas for Pakistan journalists, fans and officials would be given,\" said Mani.",
      "\"These didn't materialise. So, really, it's for BCCI to decide. Today, you have Mr. Jay Shah, who is chairman of ICC. He's been very involved with Indian cricket. It's his responsibility to make sure that this sort of thing doesn't happen again.\""

      "Iga Swiatek, who was the title favourite at Indian Wells, crashed to a semi-final defeat against 17-year-old Mira Andreeva, on Saturday. The Russian teenager reigned supreme, and began on a strong note, winning the first set via the tie-breaker (7-1), 7-6. Then the World No. 2 staged a comeback and won the second set 6-1, and it looked like Swiatek was back in the game. But in the deciding set, Andreeva sealed a resounding 6-3 win, to complete a three-setter victory (7-6, 1-6, 6-3).",
      "The match had its fair share of drama as Swiatek fell victim to controversy. The Polish ace was visibly frustrated as she failed to gain any control in most stages of the match, and showed her anger on herself and her team. She also had a meltdown with a ball kid, who gave her the ball, but she smashed it to the ground in anger. The ball kid appeared shellshocked as the ball bounced straight to Swiatek’s team.",
      "In the third set, she also ran to the chair umpire and began to argue that she was being distracted by ball kids, who were moving during her opponent’s serve.",
      "Andreeva’s tour winning streak now extends to 11 matches, and she ended Swiatek’s 10-match run.",
      "Andreeva will now face Aryna Sabalenka, who is the current World No. 1, in the finals. Both players have faced each other six times, with the teenager winning only once (2024 French Open semi-finals). This year, Sabalenka beat her 6-3, 6-2 in Brisbane and 6-1, 6-2 in Melbourne.",
      "Speaking after her semi-final win, Andreeva said, “The matches that we played this year didn’t really go my way. Yeah, I can say she almost killed me — especially in Melbourne. I’m gonna try to take a revenge, because I still have nothing to lose, and I feel like the match is going to be probably entertaining. There is going to be a lot of…I think…a lot of winners — a lot of great points.”",
      "“Now it’s going to be Conchita’s job to prepare me well for this match, so I hope she is gonna do it. But, yeah, I will just go out there as for every other match and try to play my best and to fight for every point. And then we’re gonna see who’s gonna win,” she added."

The mystery spinner returned with nine wickets in three matches, including a five-wicket haul against New Zealand in the group stage. Days after winning the tournament, the 33-year-old expressed a desire to play Test cricket for the country. However, he also described his limitation, which might be a big hurdle in playing the longest format.",
      "In the Champions Trophy, Varun played his first match for India against New Zealand in the group stage. After taking a fifer, Varun returned with two wickets each in the semi-final against Australia and the final against the Kiwis.",
      "Recently, former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin stated that Varun should have been given the Player of the Tournament accolade as he was the biggest difference in the entire competition and brought the much-needed X factor to the side led by Rohit Sharma.",
      "\"I do have an interest in Test cricket, but my bowling style doesn’t suit Test cricket,” said Varun while speaking in a podcast with Gobinath on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Mine is almost like medium pace. In Test cricket, you’ve to continuously bowl 20-30 overs. I can’t do that in my bowling. Since I bowl quick, the maximum I can bowl is 10-15 overs which is not suited for red ball. I am focusing on 20 overs and 50 overs white ball cricket for now,” he added.",
      "For the uninitiated, Varun Chakaravarthy was the second-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, only behind New Zealand's Matt Henry.",
      "Varun Chakaravarthy used to be a pacer during his college days, but he turned into a spinner after suffering an injury. He had earlier begun his cricketing journey as a wicketkeeper.",

      "“No. That’s why I am here. I would’ve been stuck there had I bowled pace. There are so many pacers. Also, it doesn’t swing in Tamil Nadu wickets. They are spin-friendly wickets. So you can’t see many fast bowlers from Tamil Nadu. It is very rare,\" said Varun.",
      "\"There is Balaji and Natarajan but there are many pacers in other states. I am happy that I left fast bowling. Even (Ravichandran) Ashwin became a spinner after leaving fast bowling. So I am happy,\" he added.",
      "Varun has come a long way in international cricket. His first stint as an international cricketer did not go as planned in the 2021 T20 World Cup. He failed to take a single wicket but a resurgence in the IPL for KKR has led to Varun finding a second wind."

The Indian captain recently led India to a brilliant win in the Champions Trophy, where India beat New Zealand in the final in Dubai, and it seems Rohit's captaincy has impressed the board, winning its faith to continue leading the side in the longest format.",
      "The U-turn over Rohit's captaincy is interesting, considering a string of India's underwhelming performances at home and away in the red-ball format over the past few months. India faced a 0-3 loss to New Zealand at home, and failed to win a single match under Rohit's captaincy in Australia.",
      "The report from Indian Express states that Rohit's tactical acumen and leadership experience seem to have been the key factors in the decision. Despite India having a rich pool of top-order batters, the selectors believe there is no immediate successor who matches Rohit's strategic expertise.",
      "His ability to handle pressure, manage bowlers effectively, and set precise fields played a significant role in winning over the decision-makers. The report states that Rohit's captaincy at the Champions Trophy, where he shuffled the spinners brilliantly and forced the opposition batters into submission, impressed the BCCI.",
      "The board has also recognized that playing in England requires patience, adaptability, and an understanding of how to control the game’s tempo – the qualities that Rohit, the BCCI believes, has exhibited in recent white-ball success.",
      "It is also believed that while India has a quality batting order, they are currently short of captaincy candidates. While the likes of Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant are relatively inexperienced to lead a side in Tests, KL Rahul's constant shuffling in the batting order, as well as his competition for spots with Pant, makes him an unsettling option.",
      "Jasprit Bumrah has led the Indian team in Rohit's absence, but his persistent issues with injuries may have also forced BCCI's hand.",
      "The decision to persist with Rohit also means that speculations will be put to rest throughout the IPL season, and India will have a clarity in their plan of action for the five-Test series against England. India last won a Test series in England in 2007 under Rahul Dravid's leadership, and came closest to beat the side in its own den during the 2021/22 tour.",

He outclassed the computers; you can check the teams who are data-driven and then check the ones who don't,” he added.",
